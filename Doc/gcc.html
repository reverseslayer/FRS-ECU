</P><P>

This manual documents how to use the GNU compilers,
as well as their features and incompatibilities, and how to report
bugs.  It corresponds to the compilers
(GCC) 
version 4.7.2.
The internals of the GNU compilers, including how to port them to new
targets and some information about how to write front ends for new
languages, are documented in a separate manual.  See section `Introduction' in <CITE>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals</CITE>.

GCC stands for "GNU Compiler Collection".  GCC is an integrated
distribution of compilers for several major programming languages.  These
languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java,
Fortran, Ada, and Go.
</P><P>

The abbreviation <EM>GCC</EM> has multiple meanings in common use.  The
current official meaning is "GNU Compiler Collection", which refers
generically to the complete suite of tools.  The name historically stood
for "GNU C Compiler", and this usage is still common when the emphasis
is on compiling C programs.  Finally, the name is also used when speaking
of the <EM>language-independent</EM> component of GCC: code shared among the
compilers for all supported languages.
</P><P>

The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the
optimizers, as well as the "back ends" that generate machine code for
various processors.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is
called the "front end".  In addition to the front ends that are
integrated components of GCC, there are several other front ends that
are maintained separately.  These support languages such as Pascal,
Mercury, and COBOL.  To use these, they must be built together with
GCC proper.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
Most of the compilers for languages other than C have their own names.
The C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  When we
talk about compiling one of those languages, we might refer to that
compiler by its own name, or as GCC.  Either is correct.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
Historically, compilers for many languages, including C++ and Fortran,
have been implemented as "preprocessors" which emit another high
level language such as C.  None of the compilers included in GCC are
implemented this way; they all generate machine code directly.  This
sort of preprocessor should not be confused with the <EM>C
preprocessor</EM>, which is an integral feature of the C, C++, Objective-C
and Objective-C++ languages.

For each language compiled by GCC for which there is a standard, GCC
attempts to follow one or more versions of that standard, possibly
with some exceptions, and possibly with some extensions.

<H2> 2.1 C language </H2>
<!--docid::SEC3::-->
<P>

GCC supports three versions of the C standard, although support for
the most recent version is not yet complete.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
The original ANSI C standard (X3.159-1989) was ratified in 1989 and
published in 1990.  This standard was ratified as an ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 9899:1990) later in 1990.  There were no technical
differences between these publications, although the sections of the
ANSI standard were renumbered and became clauses in the ISO standard.
This standard, in both its forms, is commonly known as <EM>C89</EM>, or
occasionally as <EM>C90</EM>, from the dates of ratification.  The ANSI
standard, but not the ISO standard, also came with a Rationale
document.  To select this standard in GCC, use one of the options
<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-std=c90'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std=iso9899:1990'</SAMP>; to obtain
all the diagnostics required by the standard, you should also specify
<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> (or <SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP> if you want them to be
errors rather than warnings).  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC12">Options Controlling C Dialect</A>.
</P><P>

Errors in the 1990 ISO C standard were corrected in two Technical
Corrigenda published in 1994 and 1996.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.
</P><P>

An amendment to the 1990 standard was published in 1995.  This
amendment added digraphs and <CODE>__STDC_VERSION__</CODE> to the language,
but otherwise concerned the library.  This amendment is commonly known
as <EM>AMD1</EM>; the amended standard is sometimes known as <EM>C94</EM> or
<EM>C95</EM>.  To select this standard in GCC, use the option
<SAMP>`-std=iso9899:199409'</SAMP> (with, as for other standard versions,
<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> to receive all required diagnostics).
</P><P>

A new edition of the ISO C standard was published in 1999 as ISO/IEC
9899:1999, and is commonly known as <EM>C99</EM>.  GCC has incomplete
support for this standard version; see
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/c99status.html</A> for details.  To select this
standard, use <SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std=iso9899:1999'</SAMP>.  (While in
development, drafts of this standard version were referred to as
<EM>C9X</EM>.)
</P><P>

Errors in the 1999 ISO C standard were corrected in three Technical
Corrigenda published in 2001, 2004 and 2007.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.
</P><P>

A fourth version of the C standard, known as <EM>C11</EM>, was published
in 2011 as ISO/IEC 9899:2011.  GCC has limited incomplete support for
parts of this standard, enabled with <SAMP>`-std=c11'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-std=iso9899:2011'</SAMP>.  (While in development, drafts of this
standard version were referred to as <EM>C1X</EM>.)
</P><P>

By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C language that on
rare occasions conflict with the C standard.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC54">Extensions to the C Language Family</A>.  Use of the
<SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> options listed above will disable these extensions where
they conflict with the C standard version selected.  You may also
select an extended version of the C language explicitly with
<SAMP>`-std=gnu90'</SAMP> (for C90 with GNU extensions), <SAMP>`-std=gnu99'</SAMP>
(for C99 with GNU extensions) or <SAMP>`-std=gnu11'</SAMP> (for C11 with GNU
extensions).  The default, if no C language dialect
options are given, is <SAMP>`-std=gnu90'</SAMP>; this will change to
<SAMP>`-std=gnu99'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std=gnu11'</SAMP> in some future release when
the C99 or C11 support is
complete.  Some features that are part of the C99 standard are
accepted as extensions in C90 mode, and some features that are part of
the C11 standard are accepted as extensions in C90 and C99 modes.
</P><P>

The ISO C standard defines (in clause 4) two classes of conforming
implementation.  A <EM>conforming hosted implementation</EM> supports the
whole standard including all the library facilities; a <EM>conforming
freestanding implementation</EM> is only required to provide certain
library facilities: those in <CODE>&#60;float.h&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;limits.h&#62;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#60;stdarg.h&#62;</CODE>, and <CODE>&#60;stddef.h&#62;</CODE>; since AMD1, also those in
<CODE>&#60;iso646.h&#62;</CODE>; since C99, also those in <CODE>&#60;stdbool.h&#62;</CODE> and
<CODE>&#60;stdint.h&#62;</CODE>; and since C11, also those in <CODE>&#60;stdalign.h&#62;</CODE>
and <CODE>&#60;stdnoreturn.h&#62;</CODE>.  In addition, complex types, added in C99, are not
required for freestanding implementations.  The standard also defines
two environments for programs, a <EM>freestanding environment</EM>,
required of all implementations and which may not have library
facilities beyond those required of freestanding implementations,
where the handling of program startup and termination are
implementation-defined, and a <EM>hosted environment</EM>, which is not
required, in which all the library facilities are provided and startup
is through a function <CODE>int main (void)</CODE> or <CODE>int main (int,
char *[])</CODE>.  An OS kernel would be a freestanding environment; a
program using the facilities of an operating system would normally be
in a hosted implementation.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
GCC aims towards being usable as a conforming freestanding
implementation, or as the compiler for a conforming hosted
implementation.  By default, it will act as the compiler for a hosted
implementation, defining <CODE>__STDC_HOSTED__</CODE> as <CODE>1</CODE> and
presuming that when the names of ISO C functions are used, they have
the semantics defined in the standard.  To make it act as a conforming
freestanding implementation for a freestanding environment, use the
option <SAMP>`-ffreestanding'</SAMP>; it will then define
<CODE>__STDC_HOSTED__</CODE> to <CODE>0</CODE> and not make assumptions about the
meanings of function names from the standard library, with exceptions
noted below.  To build an OS kernel, you may well still need to make
your own arrangements for linking and startup.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC12">Options Controlling C Dialect</A>.
</P><P>

GCC does not provide the library facilities required only of hosted
implementations, nor yet all the facilities required by C99 of
freestanding implementations; to use the facilities of a hosted
environment, you will need to find them elsewhere (for example, in the
GNU C library).  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC183">Standard Libraries</A>.
</P><P>

Most of the compiler support routines used by GCC are present in
<TT>`libgcc'</TT>, but there are a few exceptions.  GCC requires the
freestanding environment provide <CODE>memcpy</CODE>, <CODE>memmove</CODE>,
<CODE>memset</CODE> and <CODE>memcmp</CODE>.
Finally, if <CODE>__builtin_trap</CODE> is used, and the target does
not implement the <CODE>trap</CODE> pattern, then GCC will emit a call
to <CODE>abort</CODE>.

<H2> 2.2 C++ language </H2>
<!--docid::SEC4::-->
<P>

GCC supports the original ISO C++ standard (1998) and contains
experimental support for the second ISO C++ standard (2011).
</P><P>

The original ISO C++ standard was published as the ISO standard (ISO/IEC
14882:1998) and amended by a Technical Corrigenda published in 2003
(ISO/IEC 14882:2003). These standards are referred to as C++98 and
C++03, respectively. GCC implements the majority of C++98 (<CODE>export</CODE>
is a notable exception) and most of the changes in C++03.  To select
this standard in GCC, use one of the options <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-std=c++98'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-std=c++03'</SAMP>; to obtain all the diagnostics
required by the standard, you should also specify <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> (or
<SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP> if you want them to be errors rather than
warnings).
</P><P>

A revised ISO C++ standard was published in 2011 as ISO/IEC
14882:2011, and is referred to as C++11; before its publication it was
commonly referred to as C++0x.  C++11 contains several
changes to the C++ language, most of which have been implemented in an
experimental C++11 mode in GCC.  For information
regarding the C++11 features available in the experimental C++11 mode,
see <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/@/cxx0x.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/@/cxx0x.html</A>. To select this
standard in GCC, use the option <SAMP>`-std=c++11'</SAMP>; to obtain all the
diagnostics required by the standard, you should also specify
<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> (or <SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP> if you want them to
be errors rather than warnings).
</P><P>

More information about the C++ standards is available on the ISO C++
committee's web site at <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/@/jtc1/@/sc22/@/wg21/">http://www.open-std.org/@/jtc1/@/sc22/@/wg21/</A>.
</P><P>

By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C++ language; See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC13">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</A>.  Use of the
<SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> option listed above will disable these extensions.  You
may also select an extended version of the C++ language explicitly with
<SAMP>`-std=gnu++98'</SAMP> (for C++98 with GNU extensions) or
<SAMP>`-std=gnu++11'</SAMP> (for C++11 with GNU extensions).  The default, if
no C++ language dialect options are given, is <SAMP>`-std=gnu++98'</SAMP>.

<H2> 2.3 Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages </H2>
<!--docid::SEC5::-->
<P>

GCC supports "traditional" Objective-C (also known as "Objective-C
1.0") and contains support for the Objective-C exception and
synchronization syntax.  It has also support for a number of
"Objective-C 2.0" language extensions, including properties, fast
enumeration (only for Objective-C), method attributes and the
@optional and @required keywords in protocols.  GCC supports
Objective-C++ and features available in Objective-C are also available
in Objective-C++.
</P><P>

GCC by default uses the GNU Objective-C runtime library, which is part
of GCC and is not the same as the Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime
library used on Apple systems.  There are a number of differences
documented in this manual.  The options <SAMP>`-fgnu-runtime'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-fnext-runtime'</SAMP> allow you to switch between producing output
that works with the GNU Objective-C runtime library and output that
works with the Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime library.
</P><P>

There is no formal written standard for Objective-C or Objective-C++.
The authoritative manual on traditional Objective-C (1.0) is
"Object-Oriented Programming and the Objective-C Language",
available at a number of web sites:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.gnustep.org/@/resources/@/documentation/@/ObjectivCBook.pdf">http://www.gnustep.org/@/resources/@/documentation/@/ObjectivCBook.pdf</A>
is the original NeXTstep document;
<LI>
<A HREF="http://objc.toodarkpark.net">http://objc.toodarkpark.net</A>
is the same document in another format;
<LI>
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/@/mac/@/library/@/documentation/@/Cocoa/@/Conceptual/@/ObjectiveC/">http://developer.apple.com/@/mac/@/library/@/documentation/@/Cocoa/@/Conceptual/@/ObjectiveC/</A>
has an updated version but make sure you search for "Object Oriented Programming and the Objective-C Programming Language 1.0",
not documentation on the newer "Objective-C 2.0" language
</UL>
<P>

The Objective-C exception and synchronization syntax (that is, the
keywords @try, @throw, @catch, @finally and @synchronized) is
supported by GCC and is enabled with the option
<SAMP>`-fobjc-exceptions'</SAMP>.  The syntax is briefly documented in this
manual and in the Objective-C 2.0 manuals from Apple.
</P><P>

The Objective-C 2.0 language extensions and features are automatically
enabled; they include properties (via the @property, @synthesize and
@dynamic keywords), fast enumeration (not available in
Objective-C++), attributes for methods (such as deprecated, noreturn,
sentinel, format), the unused attribute for method arguments, the
@package keyword for instance variables and the @optional and
@required keywords in protocols.  You can disable all these
Objective-C 2.0 language extensions with the option
<SAMP>`-fobjc-std=objc1'</SAMP>, which causes the compiler to recognize the
same Objective-C language syntax recognized by GCC 4.0, and to produce
an error if one of the new features is used.
</P><P>

GCC has currently no support for non-fragile instance variables.
</P><P>

The authoritative manual on Objective-C 2.0 is available from Apple:

<H2> 2.4 Go language </H2>
<!--docid::SEC6::-->
<P>

The Go language continues to evolve as of this writing; see the
<A HREF="http://golang.org/@/doc/@/go_spec.html">current language
specifications</A>.  At present there are no specific versions of Go, and
there is no way to describe the language supported by GCC in terms of
a specific version.  In general GCC tracks the evolving specification
closely, and any given release will support the language as of the
date that the release was frozen.

<H1> 3. GCC Command Options </H1>
<!--docid::SEC8::-->
<P>

When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
</P><P>

Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC11">Compiling C++ Programs</A>, for a summary of special
options for compiling C++ programs.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
The <CODE>gcc</CODE> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <EM>not</EM> be grouped: <SAMP>`-dv'</SAMP> is very different from <SAMP>`-d
-v'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option is significant.
</P><P>

Many options have long names starting with <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or with
<SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>---for example,
<SAMP>`-fmove-loop-invariants'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC207">Option Index</A>, for an index to GCC's options.

<H2> 3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output </H2>
<!--docid::SEC10::-->
<P>

Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

<P>

If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use

one of the options <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-S'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> to say where
<CODE>gcc</CODE> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,

</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX35"></A>
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
<P>

By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.s'</SAMP>, etc., with <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input

By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP>, etc., with <SAMP>`.s'</SAMP>.

Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX37"></A>
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The

Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX39"></A>
Place output in file <VAR>file</VAR>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
<P>

If <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <TT>`a.out'</TT>, the object file for
<TT>`<VAR>source</VAR>.<VAR>suffix</VAR>'</TT> in <TT>`<VAR>source</VAR>.o'</TT>, its
assembler file in <TT>`<VAR>source</VAR>.s'</TT>, a precompiled header file in

standard output.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX40"></A>
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-###</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX41"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-v'</SAMP> except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or <CODE>./-_</CODE>.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-pipe</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX42"></A>
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.
<P>

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX43"></A>
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  If the <SAMP>`-v'</SAMP> option is also specified
then <SAMP>`--help'</SAMP> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by <CODE>gcc</CODE>, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP> option has also been specified
(prior to the <SAMP>`--help'</SAMP> option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them will also be displayed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>--target-help</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX44"></A>
Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>--help={<VAR>class</VAR>|[^]<VAR>qualifier</VAR>}[,<small>...</small>]</CODE>
<DD>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`optimizers'</SAMP>
<DD>This will display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`warnings'</SAMP>
<DD>This will display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`target'</SAMP>
<DD>This will display target-specific options.  Unlike the
<SAMP>`--target-help'</SAMP> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler will not be displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended <SAMP>`--help='</SAMP> syntax.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`params'</SAMP>
<DD>This will display the values recognized by the <SAMP>`--param'</SAMP>
option.
<P>

<DT><VAR>language</VAR>
<DD>This will display the options supported for <VAR>language</VAR>, where
<VAR>language</VAR> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`common'</SAMP>
<DD>This will display the options that are common to all languages.
</DL>
<P>

These are the supported qualifiers:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`undocumented'</SAMP>
<DD>Display only those options that are undocumented.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`joined'</SAMP>
<DD>Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
<SAMP>`--help=target'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`separate'</SAMP>
<DD>Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: <SAMP>`-o output-file'</SAMP>.
</DL>
<P>

Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler the following can be used:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>--help=target,undocumented
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>--help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The argument to <SAMP>`--help='</SAMP> should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.
</P><P>

Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output by so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work however is when one of the classes is
<VAR>target</VAR>.  So for example to display all the target-specific
optimization options the following can be used:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>--help=target,optimizers
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <SAMP>`--help='</SAMP> option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use will display its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.
</P><P>

If the <SAMP>`-Q'</SAMP> option appears on the command line before the
<SAMP>`--help='</SAMP> option, then the descriptive text displayed by
<SAMP>`--help='</SAMP> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the <SAMP>`--help='</SAMP> option is used).
</P><P>

The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> by using:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>-Q -O2 --help=optimizers
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP> by using:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &#62; /tmp/O3-opts
gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &#62; /tmp/O2-opts
diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-no-canonical-prefixes</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX45"></A>
Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to <SAMP>`/../'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`/./'</SAMP>, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.
<P>

<DT><CODE>--version</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX46"></A>
Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-wrapper</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX47"></A>
Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the
wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma separated
list.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This will invoke all subprograms of <CODE>gcc</CODE> under
<SAMP>`gdb --args'</SAMP>, thus the invocation of <CODE>cc1</CODE> will be
<SAMP>`gdb --args cc1 <small>...</small>'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fplugin=<VAR>name</VAR>.so</CODE>
<DD>Load the plugin code in file <VAR>name</VAR>.so, assumed to be a
shared object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of
the shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the
purposes of argument parsing (See
<SAMP>`-fplugin-arg-<VAR>name</VAR>-<VAR>key</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR>'</SAMP> below).
Each plugin should define the callback functions specified in the
Plugins API.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fplugin-arg-<VAR>name</VAR>-<VAR>key</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Define an argument called <VAR>key</VAR> with a value of <VAR>value</VAR>
for the plugin called <VAR>name</VAR>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdump-ada-spec[-slim]</CODE>
<DD>For C and C++ source and include files, generate corresponding Ada
specs. See section `Generating Ada Bindings for C and C++ headers' in <CITE>GNAT User's Guide</CITE>, which provides detailed documentation on this feature.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdump-go-spec=<VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
declarations in <VAR>file</VAR>.  This generates Go <CODE>const</CODE>,
<CODE>type</CODE>, <CODE>var</CODE>, and <CODE>func</CODE> declarations which may be a
useful way to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.
<P>

<DT><CODE>@<VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Read command-line options from <VAR>file</VAR>.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @<VAR>file</VAR> option.  If <VAR>file</VAR>
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.  
<P>

Options in <VAR>file</VAR> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The <VAR>file</VAR> may itself contain additional
@<VAR>file</VAR> options; any such options will be processed recursively.

<!--docid::SEC11::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <SAMP>`.C'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`.cc'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.cpp'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.CPP'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.c++'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.cp'</SAMP>, or
<SAMP>`.cxx'</SAMP>; C++ header files often use <SAMP>`.hh'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.hpp'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`.H'</SAMP>, or (for shared template code) <SAMP>`.tcc'</SAMP>; and
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix <SAMP>`.ii'</SAMP>.  GCC recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name <CODE>gcc</CODE>).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
However, the use of <CODE>gcc</CODE> does not add the C++ library.
<CODE>g++</CODE> is a program that calls GCC and treats <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`.h'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP> files as C++ source files instead of C source
files unless <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> is used, and automatically specifies linking
against the C++ library.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a <SAMP>`.h'</SAMP> extension for use in C++
compilations.  On many systems, <CODE>g++</CODE> is also installed with
the name <CODE>c++</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC12">Options Controlling C Dialect</A>, for

<H2> 3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect </H2>
<!--docid::SEC12::-->
<P>

The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<DT><CODE>-ansi</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX55"></A>
In C mode, this is equivalent to <SAMP>`-std=c90'</SAMP>. In C++ mode, it is
equivalent to <SAMP>`-std=c++98'</SAMP>.
<P>

This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the <CODE>asm</CODE> and <CODE>typeof</CODE> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <CODE>unix</CODE> and <CODE>vax</CODE> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style <SAMP>`//'</SAMP> comments as well as
the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword.
</P><P>

The alternate keywords <CODE>__asm__</CODE>, <CODE>__extension__</CODE>,
<CODE>__inline__</CODE> and <CODE>__typeof__</CODE> continue to work despite
<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <CODE>__unix__</CODE> and <CODE>__vax__</CODE> are also available, with or
without <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> is required in
addition to <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC16">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</A>.
</P><P>

The macro <CODE>__STRICT_ANSI__</CODE> is predefined when the <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
</P><P>

Functions that would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <CODE>alloca</CODE> and <CODE>ffs</CODE>) are not built-in
functions when <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is used.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC117">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</A>, for details of the functions
affected.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-std=</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX56"></A>
Determine the language standard. See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC2">Language Standards Supported by GCC</A>, for details of these standard versions.  This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.
<P>

The compiler can accept several base standards, such as <SAMP>`c90'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`c++98'</SAMP>, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
<SAMP>`gnu90'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`gnu++98'</SAMP>.  By specifying a base standard, the
compiler will accept all programs following that standard and those
using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
<SAMP>`-std=c90'</SAMP> turns off certain features of GCC that are
incompatible with ISO C90, such as the <CODE>asm</CODE> and <CODE>typeof</CODE>
keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in
ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a <CODE>?:</CODE>
expression. On the other hand, by specifying a GNU dialect of a
standard, all features the compiler support are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard and some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> to identify which features are GNU
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
<SAMP>`-std=gnu90 -pedantic'</SAMP> would warn about C++ style <SAMP>`//'</SAMP>
comments, while <SAMP>`-std=gnu99 -pedantic'</SAMP> would not.
</P><P>

<DD>GNU dialect of ISO C99.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in GCC,
this will become the default.  The name <SAMP>`gnu9x'</SAMP> is deprecated.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`gnu11'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`gnu1x'</SAMP>
<DD>GNU dialect of ISO C11.  Support is incomplete and experimental.  The
name <SAMP>`gnu1x'</SAMP> is deprecated.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`c++98'</SAMP>
<DD>The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments. Same as <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> for
C++ code.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`gnu++98'</SAMP>
<DD>GNU dialect of <SAMP>`-std=c++98'</SAMP>.  This is the default for
C++ code.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`c++11'</SAMP>
<DD>The 2011 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.  Support for C++11 is still
experimental, and may change in incompatible ways in future releases.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`gnu++11'</SAMP>
<DD>GNU dialect of <SAMP>`-std=c++11'</SAMP>. Support for C++11 is still
experimental, and may change in incompatible ways in future releases.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fgnu89-inline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX57"></A>
The option <SAMP>`-fgnu89-inline'</SAMP> tells GCC to use the traditional
GNU semantics for <CODE>inline</CODE> functions when in C99 mode.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC95">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</A>.  This option
is accepted and ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up to but not including
4.3.  In GCC versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of GCC in
C99 mode.  Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
<CODE>gnu_inline</CODE> function attribute to all inline functions
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>).
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-fno-gnu89-inline'</SAMP> explicitly tells GCC to use the
C99 semantics for <CODE>inline</CODE> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior).  This option was first supported in
GCC 4.3.  This option is not supported in <SAMP>`-std=c90'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-std=gnu90'</SAMP> mode.
</P><P>

The preprocessor macros <CODE>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</CODE> and
<CODE>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</CODE> may be used to check which semantics are
in effect for <CODE>inline</CODE> functions.  See section `Common Predefined Macros' in <CITE>The C Preprocessor</CITE>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-aux-info <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX58"></A>
Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.
<P>

Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<SAMP>`I'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`N'</SAMP> for new or
<SAMP>`O'</SAMP> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (<SAMP>`C'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`F'</SAMP>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&#38;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions</CODE>
<DD>Accept variadic functions without named parameters.
<P>

Although it is possible to define such a function, this is not very
useful as it is not possible to read the arguments.  This is only
supported for C as this construct is allowed by C++.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-asm</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX59"></A>
Do not recognize <CODE>asm</CODE>, <CODE>inline</CODE> or <CODE>typeof</CODE> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <CODE>__asm__</CODE>, <CODE>__inline__</CODE> and <CODE>__typeof__</CODE>
instead.  <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> implies <SAMP>`-fno-asm'</SAMP>.
<P>

In C++, this switch only affects the <CODE>typeof</CODE> keyword, since
<CODE>asm</CODE> and <CODE>inline</CODE> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <SAMP>`-fno-gnu-keywords'</SAMP> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std=gnu99'</SAMP>), this
switch only affects the <CODE>asm</CODE> and <CODE>typeof</CODE> keywords, since
<CODE>inline</CODE> is a standard keyword in ISO C99.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-builtin</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-builtin-<VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<SAMP>`__builtin_'</SAMP> as prefix.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC117">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</A>, for details of the functions affected,
including those which are not built-in functions when <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.
<P>

GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <CODE>alloca</CODE> may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to <CODE>memcpy</CODE>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> for bad calls to
<CODE>printf</CODE>, when <CODE>printf</CODE> is built in, and <CODE>strlen</CODE> is
known not to modify global memory.
</P><P>

With the <SAMP>`-fno-builtin-<VAR>function</VAR>'</SAMP> option
only the built-in function <VAR>function</VAR> is
disabled.  <VAR>function</VAR> must not begin with <SAMP>`__builtin_'</SAMP>.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<SAMP>`-fbuiltin-<VAR>function</VAR>'</SAMP> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <SAMP>`-fno-builtin'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-ffreestanding'</SAMP>, you may define macros such as:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
#define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fhosted</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<P>

Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<SAMP>`-fbuiltin'</SAMP>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <CODE>main</CODE> has a return
type of <CODE>int</CODE>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to <SAMP>`-fno-freestanding'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ffreestanding</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<P>

Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies <SAMP>`-fno-builtin'</SAMP>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <CODE>main</CODE>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel.
This is equivalent to <SAMP>`-fno-hosted'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC2">Language Standards Supported by GCC</A>, for details of
freestanding and hosted environments.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fopenmp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
Enable handling of OpenMP directives <CODE>#pragma omp</CODE> in C/C++ and
<CODE>!$omp</CODE> in Fortran.  When <SAMP>`-fopenmp'</SAMP> is specified, the
compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v3.0 <A HREF="http://www.openmp.org/">http://www.openmp.org/</A>.  This option
implies <SAMP>`-pthread'</SAMP>, and thus is only supported on targets that
have support for <SAMP>`-pthread'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fgnu-tm</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX68"></A>
When the option <SAMP>`-fgnu-tm'</SAMP> is specified, the compiler will
generate code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional
Memory ABI specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is
an experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions
of GCC, as the official specification changes.  Please note that not
all architectures are supported for this feature.
<P>

For more information on GCC's support for transactional memory,
See section `The GNU Transactional Memory Library' in <CITE>GNU Transactional Memory Library</CITE>.
</P><P>

Note that the transactional memory feature is not supported with
non-call exceptions (<SAMP>`-fnon-call-exceptions'</SAMP>).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fms-extensions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX69"></A>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.
<P>

In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar
to previous types declarations.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int UOW;
struct ABC {
  UOW UOW;
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC129">Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions</A>, for details.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fplan9-extensions</CODE>
<DD>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.
<P>

This enables <SAMP>`-fms-extensions'</SAMP>, permits passing pointers to
structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect pointers to
elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to anonymous
fields declared using a typedef.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC129">Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions</A>, for details.  This is only
supported for C, not C++.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-trigraphs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX70"></A>
Support ISO C trigraphs.  The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option (and <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP>
options for strict ISO C conformance) implies <SAMP>`-trigraphs'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-no-integrated-cpp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX71"></A>
Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This
option allows a user supplied "cc1", "cc1plus", or "cc1obj" via the
<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> option.  The user supplied compilation step can then add in
an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before
compiling.  The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)
<P>

The semantics of this option will change if "cc1", "cc1plus", and
"cc1obj" are merged.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<DT><CODE>-traditional</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-traditional-cpp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> switch.
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the GNU
CPP manual for details.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcond-mismatch</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX76"></A>
Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C++.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-flax-vector-conversions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX77"></A>
Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-funsigned-char</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX78"></A>
Let the type <CODE>char</CODE> be unsigned, like <CODE>unsigned char</CODE>.
<P>

Each kind of machine has a default for what <CODE>char</CODE> should
be.  It is either like <CODE>unsigned char</CODE> by default or like
<CODE>signed char</CODE> by default.
</P><P>

Ideally, a portable program should always use <CODE>signed char</CODE> or
<CODE>unsigned char</CODE> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <CODE>char</CODE> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
</P><P>

The type <CODE>char</CODE> is always a distinct type from each of
<CODE>signed char</CODE> or <CODE>unsigned char</CODE>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsigned-char</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX79"></A>
Let the type <CODE>char</CODE> be signed, like <CODE>signed char</CODE>.
<P>

Note that this is equivalent to <SAMP>`-fno-unsigned-char'</SAMP>, which is
the negative form of <SAMP>`-funsigned-char'</SAMP>.  Likewise, the option
<SAMP>`-fno-signed-char'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`-funsigned-char'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsigned-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-funsigned-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-signed-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <CODE>signed</CODE> or <CODE>unsigned</CODE>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <CODE>int</CODE> are signed types.

<!--docid::SEC13::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <CODE>firstClass.C</CODE> like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, only <SAMP>`-frepo'</SAMP> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.
</P><P>

Here is a list of options that are <EM>only</EM> for compiling C++ programs:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-fabi-version=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX87"></A>
Use version <VAR>n</VAR> of the C++ ABI.  Version 2 is the version of the
C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be
the version that conforms most closely to the C++ ABI specification.
Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change as ABI bugs
are fixed.
<P>

The default is version 2.
</P><P>

Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.
</P><P>

Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.
</P><P>

Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.
</P><P>

Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and --, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.
</P><P>

See also <SAMP>`-Wabi'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-access-control</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX88"></A>
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcheck-new</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX89"></A>
Check that the pointer returned by <CODE>operator new</CODE> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<CODE>operator new</CODE> will only return <CODE>0</CODE> if it is declared
<SAMP>`throw()'</SAMP>, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<CODE>operator new</CODE> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <CODE>std::bad_alloc</CODE>.  See also
<SAMP>`new (nothrow)'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fconserve-space</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX90"></A>
Put uninitialized or run-time-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after <CODE>main()</CODE> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.
<P>

This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into BSS without making them common.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fconstexpr-depth=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX91"></A>
Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions
to <VAR>n</VAR>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdeduce-init-list</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX92"></A>
Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
std::initializer_list from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>template &#60;class T&#62; auto forward(T t) -&#62; decltype (realfn (t))
{
  return realfn (t);
}

void f()
{
  forward({1,2}); // call forward&#60;std::initializer_list&#60;int&#62;&#62;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the C++11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ffriend-injection</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX93"></A>
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C++ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in ISO C++ a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.
<P>

This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-elide-constructors</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX94"></A>
The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX95"></A>
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<SAMP>`NDEBUG'</SAMP>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
will still optimize based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception will result in undefined behavior.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ffor-scope</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-for-scope</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX96"></A>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
If <SAMP>`-ffor-scope'</SAMP> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> is limited to the <SAMP>`for'</SAMP> loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard.
If <SAMP>`-fno-for-scope'</SAMP> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.
<P>

The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-gnu-keywords</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX98"></A>
Do not recognize <CODE>typeof</CODE> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <CODE>__typeof__</CODE> instead.
<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> implies <SAMP>`-fno-gnu-keywords'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-implicit-templates</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX99"></A>
Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC139">7.5 Where's the Template?</A>, for more information.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX100"></A>
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-implement-inlines</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX101"></A>
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fms-extensions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX102"></A>
Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-nonansi-builtins</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX103"></A>
Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include <CODE>ffs</CODE>, <CODE>alloca</CODE>, <CODE>_exit</CODE>,
<CODE>index</CODE>, <CODE>bzero</CODE>, <CODE>conjf</CODE>, and other related functions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fnothrow-opt</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX104"></A>
Treat a <CODE>throw()</CODE> exception specification as though it were a
<CODE>noexcept</CODE> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification will actually make the
function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification will result in a call
to <CODE>terminate</CODE> rather than <CODE>unexpected</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-operator-names</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX105"></A>
Do not treat the operator name keywords <CODE>and</CODE>, <CODE>bitand</CODE>,
<CODE>bitor</CODE>, <CODE>compl</CODE>, <CODE>not</CODE>, <CODE>or</CODE> and <CODE>xor</CODE> as
synonyms as keywords.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-optional-diags</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX106"></A>
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpermissive</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX107"></A>
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <SAMP>`-fpermissive'</SAMP> will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-pretty-templates</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX108"></A>
When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler will normally print the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. <CODE>void f(T) [with T = int]</CODE>
rather than <CODE>void f(int)</CODE>) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler will omit any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, using <SAMP>`-fno-pretty-templates'</SAMP> will disable them.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-frepo</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX109"></A>
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <SAMP>`-fno-implicit-templates'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC139">7.5 Where's the Template?</A>, for more information.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-rtti</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX110"></A>
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features
(<SAMP>`dynamic_cast'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`typeid'</SAMP>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed. The <SAMP>`dynamic_cast'</SAMP> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <CODE>void *</CODE> or to
unambiguous base classes.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstats</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX111"></A>
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstrict-enums</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX112"></A>
Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C++ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftemplate-depth=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX113"></A>
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <VAR>n</VAR>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in C++11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-threadsafe-statics</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX114"></A>
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++
ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fuse-cxa-atexit</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX115"></A>
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<CODE>__cxa_atexit</CODE> function rather than the <CODE>atexit</CODE> function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
<CODE>__cxa_atexit</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX116"></A>
Don't use the <CODE>__cxa_get_exception_ptr</CODE> runtime routine.  This
will cause <CODE>std::uncaught_exception</CODE> to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX117"></A>
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
were taken in different shared objects.
<P>

The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<CODE>__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))</CODE> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
</P><P>

The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
</P><P>

You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility will have no effect.
</P><P>

Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC139">7.5 Where's the Template?</A>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fvisibility-ms-compat</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX118"></A>
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
<P>

The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
It sets the default visibility to <CODE>hidden</CODE>, like
<SAMP>`-fvisibility=hidden'</SAMP>.
<P>

<LI>
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
<P>

<LI>
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one different
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they would have
been permitted when this option was not used.
</OL>
<P>

In new code it is better to use <SAMP>`-fvisibility=hidden'</SAMP> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
</P><P>

Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects will be different, so changing one will not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-weak</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX119"></A>
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdinc++</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX120"></A>
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.)
</DL>
<P>

In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fno-default-inline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX121"></A>
Do not assume <SAMP>`inline'</SAMP> for functions defined inside a class scope.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC18">Options That Control Optimization</A>.  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wabi (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.
<P>

You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
</P><P>

The known incompatibilities in <SAMP>`-fabi-version=2'</SAMP> (the default) include:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type is
mangled incorrectly:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern int N;
template &#60;int &#38;&#62; struct S {};
void n (S&#60;N&#62;) {2}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table><P>

This is fixed in <SAMP>`-fabi-version=3'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<LI>
SIMD vector types declared using <CODE>__attribute ((vector_size))</CODE> are
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes.
<P>

The mangling is changed in <SAMP>`-fabi-version=4'</SAMP>.
</UL>
<P>

The known incompatibilities in <SAMP>`-fabi-version=1'</SAMP> include:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this case, G++ will place <CODE>B::f2</CODE> into the same byte
as<CODE>A::f1</CODE>; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding <CODE>A</CODE> so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout <CODE>B</CODE> identically.
</P><P>

<LI>
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
struct B { B(); char c2; };
struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this case, G++ will not place <CODE>B</CODE> into the tail-padding for
<CODE>A</CODE>; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding <CODE>A</CODE> so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout <CODE>C</CODE> identically.
</P><P>

<LI>
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>union U { int i : 4096; };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Assuming that an <CODE>int</CODE> does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an <CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

<LI>
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A {};

struct B {
  A a;
  virtual void f ();
};

struct C : public B, public A {};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

G++ will place the <CODE>A</CODE> base class of <CODE>C</CODE> at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
<CODE>A</CODE> data member of <CODE>B</CODE> is already at offset zero.
</P><P>

<LI>
Names of template functions whose types involve <CODE>typename</CODE> or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>template &#60;typename Q&#62;
void f(typename Q::X) {}

template &#60;template &#60;typename&#62; class Q&#62;
void f(typename Q&#60;int&#62;::X) {}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.
</P><P>

</UL>
<P>

It also warns psABI related changes.  The known psABI changes at this
point include:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
For SYSV/x86-64, when passing union with long double, it is changed to
pass in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>union U {
  long double ld;
  int i;
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<CODE>union U</CODE> will always be passed in memory.
</P><P>

</UL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
Warn when <SAMP>`delete'</SAMP> is used to destroy an instance of a class that
has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base class if the
base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled
by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnarrowing (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
Warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs within
<SAMP>`{ }'</SAMP>, e.g.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This flag is included in <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Wc++11-compat'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

With -std=c++11, <SAMP>`-Wno-narrowing'</SAMP> suppresses the diagnostic
required by the standard.  Note that this does not affect the meaning
of well-formed code; narrowing conversions are still considered
ill-formed in SFINAE context.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnoexcept (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call
to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
specification (i.e. <SAMP>`throw()'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`noexcept'</SAMP>) but is known by
the compiler to never throw an exception.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX132"></A>
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
Warn when a class has virtual functions and accessible non-virtual
destructor, in which case it would be possible but unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to the base class.
This warning is also enabled if <SAMP>`-Weffc++'</SAMP> is specified.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wreorder (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX134"></A>
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A {
  int i;
  int j;
  A(): j (0), i (1) { }
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The compiler will rearrange the member initializers for <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> to match the declaration order of the members, emitting
a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</DL>
<P>

The following <SAMP>`-W<small>...</small>'</SAMP> options are not affected by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-Weffc++ (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
<CITE>Effective C++, Second Edition</CITE> book:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
Item 11:  Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes
with dynamically allocated memory.
<P>

<LI>
Item 12:  Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.
<P>

<LI>
Item 14:  Make destructors virtual in base classes.
<P>

<LI>
Item 15:  Have <CODE>operator=</CODE> return a reference to <CODE>*this</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
Item 23:  Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

Also warn about violations of the following style guidelines from
Scott Meyers' <CITE>More Effective C++</CITE> book:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Item 6:  Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
decrement operators.
<P>

<LI>
Item 7:  Never overload <CODE>&#38;&#38;</CODE>, <CODE>||</CODE>, or <CODE>,</CODE>.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library
headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use <SAMP>`grep -v'</SAMP>
to filter out those warnings.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-null-sentinel (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX140"></A>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
Warn also about the use of an uncasted <CODE>NULL</CODE> as sentinel.  When
compiling only with GCC this is a valid sentinel, as <CODE>NULL</CODE> is defined
to <CODE>__null</CODE>.  Although it is a null pointer constant not a null pointer,
it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is
not portable across different compilers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX142"></A>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
<SAMP>`friend foo(int)'</SAMP>), the C++ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, <SAMP>`-Wnon-template-friend'</SAMP> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
<SAMP>`-Wno-non-template-friend'</SAMP>, which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wold-style-cast (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX144"></A>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a C++ program.  The new-style casts (<SAMP>`dynamic_cast'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`static_cast'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`reinterpret_cast'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`const_cast'</SAMP>) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX146"></A>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A {
  virtual void f();
};

struct B: public A {
  void f(int);
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the <CODE>A</CODE> class version of <CODE>f</CODE> is hidden in <CODE>B</CODE>, and code
like:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>B* b;
b-&#62;f();
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will fail to compile.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX150"></A>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsign-promo (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct A {
  operator int ();
  A&#38; operator = (int);
};

main ()
{
  A a,b;
  a = b;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, G++ will synthesize a default <SAMP>`A&#38; operator =
(const A&#38;);'</SAMP>, while cfront will use the user-defined <SAMP>`operator ='</SAMP>.

<!--docid::SEC14::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC2">Language Standards Supported by GCC</A>, for references.)
</P><P>

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs, but you can also use most of
the language-independent GNU compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file <CODE>some_class.m</CODE> like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, <SAMP>`-fgnu-runtime'</SAMP> is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by GCC.
</P><P>

Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
<SAMP>`-Wtraditional'</SAMP>).  Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may use
C++-specific options (e.g., <SAMP>`-Wabi'</SAMP>).
</P><P>

Here is a list of options that are <EM>only</EM> for compiling Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fconstant-string-class=<VAR>class-name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX157"></A>
Use <VAR>class-name</VAR> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <CODE>@"<small>...</small>"</CODE>.  The default
class name is <CODE>NXConstantString</CODE> if the GNU runtime is being used, and
<CODE>NSConstantString</CODE> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
<SAMP>`-fconstant-cfstrings'</SAMP> option, if also present, will override the
<SAMP>`-fconstant-string-class'</SAMP> setting and cause <CODE>@"<small>...</small>"</CODE> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fgnu-runtime</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX158"></A>
Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fnext-runtime</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX159"></A>
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The macro
<CODE>__NEXT_RUNTIME__</CODE> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-nil-receivers</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX160"></A>
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (<CODE>[receiver
message:arg]</CODE>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not <CODE>nil</CODE>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime and ABI version 0 or 1.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fobjc-abi-version=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX161"></A>
Use version <VAR>n</VAR> of the Objective-C ABI for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI.  If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX162"></A>
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C++ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special <CODE>- (id) .cxx_construct</CODE> instance method which will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return <CODE>self</CODE>.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C++ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special <CODE>- (void) .cxx_destruct</CODE> method which will run
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
<P>

The <CODE>- (id) .cxx_construct</CODE> and <CODE>- (void) .cxx_destruct</CODE>
methods thusly generated will only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The <CODE>- (id) .cxx_construct</CODE> methods will be invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the <CODE>- (void) .cxx_destruct</CODE> methods will be invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
</P><P>

As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the <CODE>- (id) .cxx_construct</CODE> and
<CODE>- (void) .cxx_destruct</CODE> methods.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fobjc-direct-dispatch</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX163"></A>
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fobjc-exceptions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX164"></A>
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords <CODE>@try</CODE>,
<CODE>@throw</CODE>, <CODE>@catch</CODE>, <CODE>@finally</CODE> and
<CODE>@synchronized</CODE>.  This option is available with both the GNU
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fobjc-gc</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX165"></A>
Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
GNU runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fobjc-nilcheck</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX166"></A>
For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
This is the default and can be disabled using
<SAMP>`-fno-objc-nilcheck'</SAMP>.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.
Currently this flag does nothing when the GNU runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime ABI, is used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fobjc-std=objc1</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX167"></A>
Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by GCC 4.0.  This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/C++ language; it does not affect conformance to C/C++ standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/C++ dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by GCC 4.0 is rejected.
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of GCC.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-freplace-objc-classes</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX168"></A>
Emit a special marker instructing <CODE>ld(1)</CODE> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow <CODE>dyld(1)</CODE> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3
and later.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fzero-link</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX169"></A>
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <CODE>objc_getClass("<small>...</small>")</CODE> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the <SAMP>`-fzero-link'</SAMP> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <CODE>objc_getClass("<small>...</small>")</CODE>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
The GNU runtime currently always retains calls to <CODE>objc_get_class("<small>...</small>")</CODE>
regardless of command-line options.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gen-decls</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX170"></A>
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a

<DT><CODE>-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX173"></A>
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <SAMP>`-Wno-protocol'</SAMP> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX175"></A>
<A NAME="IDX176"></A>
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a <CODE>@selector(<small>...</small>)</CODE>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <SAMP>`-fsyntax-only'</SAMP> option is
being used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-selector-match (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX177"></A>
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type <CODE>id</CODE> or <CODE>Class</CODE>.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size
and alignment.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX179"></A>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
Warn if a <CODE>@selector(<small>...</small>)</CODE> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
<CODE>@selector(<small>...</small>)</CODE> expression, either explicitly in an
<CODE>@interface</CODE> or <CODE>@protocol</CODE> declaration, or implicitly in
an <CODE>@implementation</CODE> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <CODE>@selector(<small>...</small>)</CODE> expression is found,
while <SAMP>`-Wselector'</SAMP> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.
<P>

<H2> 3.7 Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting </H2>
<!--docid::SEC15::-->
<P>

Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, <small>...</small>).  The options described
below can be used to control the diagnostic messages formatting
algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the C++ front end can
honor these options.  However it is expected, in the near future, that
the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fmessage-length=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX182"></A>
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about <VAR>n</VAR>
characters.  The default is 72 characters for <CODE>g++</CODE> and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by GCC.  If <VAR>n</VAR> is zero, then no
line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a single
line.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<DT><CODE>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</CODE>
<DD>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit <EM>once</EM> source location information; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</CODE>
<DD>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX184"></A>
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
<SAMP>`-fno-diagnostics-show-option'</SAMP> flag suppresses that behavior.

<H2> 3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings </H2>
<!--docid::SEC16::-->
<P>

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
</P><P>

The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
<DT><CODE>-fsyntax-only</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX187"></A>
Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fmax-errors=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX188"></A>
Limits the maximum number of error messages to <VAR>n</VAR>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <VAR>n</VAR> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <SAMP>`-Wfatal-errors'</SAMP> is also
specified, then <SAMP>`-Wfatal-errors'</SAMP> takes precedence over this
option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX189"></A>
Inhibit all warning messages.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Werror</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
Make all warnings into errors.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Werror=</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended, for example <SAMP>`-Werror=switch'</SAMP> turns the warnings
controlled by <SAMP>`-Wswitch'</SAMP> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <SAMP>`-Werror'</SAMP> for specific
warnings, for example <SAMP>`-Wno-error=switch'</SAMP> makes
<SAMP>`-Wswitch'</SAMP> warnings not be errors, even when <SAMP>`-Werror'</SAMP>
is in effect.
<P>

The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<SAMP>`-Werror='</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Wno-error='</SAMP> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<SAMP>`-fno-diagnostics-show-option'</SAMP> flag.)
</P><P>

Note that specifying <SAMP>`-Werror='</SAMP><VAR>foo</VAR> automatically implies
<SAMP>`-W'</SAMP><VAR>foo</VAR>.  However, <SAMP>`-Wno-error='</SAMP><VAR>foo</VAR> does not
imply anything.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wfatal-errors</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX194"></A>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

You can request many specific warnings with options beginning
<SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>, for example <SAMP>`-Wimplicit'</SAMP> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning <SAMP>`-Wno-'</SAMP> to turn off warnings; for
example, <SAMP>`-Wno-implicit'</SAMP>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further,
language-specific options also refer to <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC13">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</A> and
<A HREF="gcc.html#SEC14">3.6 Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects</A>.
</P><P>

When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<SAMP>`-Wunknown-warning'</SAMP>), GCC will emit a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <SAMP>`-Wno-'</SAMP> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: No diagnostic will be
produced for <SAMP>`-Wno-unknown-warning'</SAMP> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <SAMP>`-Wno-'</SAMP> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler will
warn that an unrecognized option was used.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-pedantic</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX196"></A>
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> option used.
<P>

Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> or a
<SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<CODE>__extension__</CODE>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC108">6.45 Alternate Keywords</A>.
</P><P>

Some users try to use <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all--only those for which
ISO C <EM>requires</EM> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
</P><P>

A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
</P><P>

Where the standard specified with <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as <SAMP>`gnu90'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`gnu99'</SAMP>, there is a
corresponding <EM>base standard</EM>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-pedantic-errors</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX197"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wall</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC13">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</A> and <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC14">3.6 Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects</A>.
<P>

<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> turns on the following warning flags:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{-Waddress   
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table>-Warray-bounds (only with <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>)  
-Wc++11-compat

-Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only)

-Wunused-function  
-Wunused-label     
-Wunused-value     
-Wunused-variable  
-Wvolatile-register-var 
}
</P><P>

Note that some warning flags are not implied by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP> but many of
them must be enabled individually.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wextra</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>. (This option used to be called <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>.  The older
name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{-Wclobbered

</P><P>

The option <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP> also prints warning messages for the
following cases:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
A pointer is compared against integer zero with <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`&#60;='</SAMP>,

<DT><CODE>-Wchar-subscripts</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
Warn if an array subscript has type <CODE>char</CODE>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wcomment</CODE>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX207"></A>
Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
<SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP> option.
If a source file was changed between <SAMP>`-fprofile-gen'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  <SAMP>`-Wno-coverage-mismatch'</SAMP> can be used to disable the
warning or <SAMP>`-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch'</SAMP> can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-cpp</CODE>
<DD>(C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)
<P>

Suppress warning messages emitted by <CODE>#warning</CODE> directives.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wdouble-promotion (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX208"></A>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
Give a warning when a value of type <CODE>float</CODE> is implicitly
promoted to <CODE>double</CODE>.  CPUs with a 32-bit "single-precision"
floating-point unit implement <CODE>float</CODE> in hardware, but emulate
<CODE>double</CODE> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using <CODE>double</CODE> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.
<P>

It is easy to accidentally do computations with <CODE>double</CODE> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type <CODE>double</CODE>.  For
example, in:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>float area(float radius)
{
   return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table>the compiler will perform the entire computation with <CODE>double</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>

Check calls to <CODE>printf</CODE> and <CODE>scanf</CODE>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>), in the <CODE>printf</CODE>,
<CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE> and <CODE>strfmon</CODE> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<SAMP>`-ffreestanding'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-fno-builtin'</SAMP>.
<P>

The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> is used
with <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP>, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <CODE>strfmon</CODE> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC12">Options Controlling C Dialect</A>.
</P><P>

Since <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> also implies <SAMP>`-Wnonnull'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> is included in <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options <SAMP>`-Wformat-y2k'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-Wno-format-extra-args'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Wno-format-zero-length'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-Wformat-nonliteral'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Wformat-security'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`-Wformat=2'</SAMP> are available, but are not included in <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wformat-y2k</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
If <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> is specified, also warn about <CODE>strftime</CODE>
formats that may yield only a two-digit year.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-format-contains-nul</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
If <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> is specified, do not warn about format strings that
contain NUL bytes.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-format-extra-args</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
If <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
<CODE>printf</CODE> or <CODE>scanf</CODE> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.
<P>

Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <CODE>va_arg</CODE> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <CODE>scanf</CODE> formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-format-zero-length</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
If <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wformat-nonliteral</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
If <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a <CODE>va_list</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wformat-security</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
If <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to <CODE>printf</CODE> and <CODE>scanf</CODE> functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in <CODE>printf (foo);</CODE>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains <SAMP>`%n'</SAMP>.  (This is
currently a subset of what <SAMP>`-Wformat-nonliteral'</SAMP> warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to <SAMP>`-Wformat-security'</SAMP> that are not
included in <SAMP>`-Wformat-nonliteral'</SAMP>.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wformat=2</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX226"></A>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
Enable <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> plus format checks not included in

-Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnonnull</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX228"></A>
<A NAME="IDX229"></A>
Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the <CODE>nonnull</CODE> function attribute.
<P>

<SAMP>`-Wnonnull'</SAMP> is included in <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP>.  It
can be disabled with the <SAMP>`-Wno-nonnull'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Winit-self (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX230"></A>
<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the <SAMP>`-Wuninitialized'</SAMP> option.
<P>

For example, GCC will warn about <CODE>i</CODE> being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when <SAMP>`-Winit-self'</SAMP> has been specified:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int f()

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX232"></A>

Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.
This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
Give a warning whenever a function is used before being declared. In
C99 mode (<SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std=gnu99'</SAMP>), this warning is
enabled by default and it is made into an error by
<SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP>. This warning is also enabled by
<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wimplicit (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
Same as <SAMP>`-Wimplicit-int'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Wimplicit-function-declaration'</SAMP>.
This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wignored-qualifiers (C and C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX238"></A>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as <CODE>const</CODE>.  For ISO C such a type qualifier has no effect,
since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.
For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or <CODE>void</CODE>.
ISO C prohibits qualified <CODE>void</CODE> return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning
even without this option.
<P>

This warning is also enabled by <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmain</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX240"></A>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
Warn if the type of <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> is suspicious.  <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> should be
a function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This warning
is enabled by default in C++ and is enabled by either <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-braces</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX242"></A>
<A NAME="IDX243"></A>
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> is not fully
bracketed, but that for <SAMP>`b'</SAMP> is fully bracketed.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wparentheses</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX246"></A>
<A NAME="IDX247"></A>
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
<P>

Also warn if a comparison like <SAMP>`x&#60;=y&#60;=z'</SAMP> appears; this is
equivalent to <SAMP>`(x&#60;=y ? 1 : 0) &#60;= z'</SAMP>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
</P><P>

Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<CODE>if</CODE> statement an <CODE>else</CODE> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{
  if (a)
    if (b)
      foo ();
  else
    bar ();
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In C/C++, every <CODE>else</CODE> branch belongs to the innermost possible
<CODE>if</CODE> statement, which in this example is <CODE>if (b)</CODE>.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost <CODE>if</CODE> statement so there is no way the <CODE>else</CODE>
could belong to the enclosing <CODE>if</CODE>.  The resulting code would
look like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{
  if (a)
    {
      if (b)
        foo ();
      else
        bar ();
    }
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Also warn for dangerous uses of the
?: with omitted middle operand GNU extension. When the condition
in the ?: operator is a boolean expression the omitted value will
be always 1. Often the user expects it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
</P><P>

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsequence-point</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX248"></A>
<A NAME="IDX249"></A>
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.
<P>

The C and C++ standards defines the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <EM>sequence points</EM>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<CODE>&#38;&#38;</CODE>, <CODE>||</CODE>, <CODE>? :</CODE> or <CODE>,</CODE> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
</P><P>

It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that "Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
</P><P>

Examples of code with undefined behavior are <CODE>a = a++;</CODE>, <CODE>a[n]
= b[n++]</CODE> and <CODE>a[i++] = i;</CODE>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
</P><P>

The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/@/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/@/readings.html</A>.

<DT><CODE>-Wreturn-type</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX250"></A>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults
to <CODE>int</CODE>.  Also warn about any <CODE>return</CODE> statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not <CODE>void</CODE>
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value), and about a <CODE>return</CODE> statement with an
expression in a function whose return-type is <CODE>void</CODE>.
<P>

For C++, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when <SAMP>`-Wno-return-type'</SAMP> is specified.  The only
exceptions are <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> and functions defined in system headers.
</P><P>

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wswitch</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX252"></A>
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
Warn whenever a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a <CODE>case</CODE> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a <CODE>default</CODE> label prevents this
warning.)  <CODE>case</CODE> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a
<CODE>default</CODE> label).
This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wswitch-default</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX254"></A>
<A NAME="IDX255"></A>
Warn whenever a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement does not have a <CODE>default</CODE>
case.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wswitch-enum</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX256"></A>
<A NAME="IDX257"></A>
Warn whenever a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a <CODE>case</CODE> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  <CODE>case</CODE> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
between <SAMP>`-Wswitch'</SAMP> and this option is that this option gives a
warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
<CODE>default</CODE> label.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsync-nand (C and C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX258"></A>
<A NAME="IDX259"></A>
Warn when <CODE>__sync_fetch_and_nand</CODE> and <CODE>__sync_nand_and_fetch</CODE>
built-in functions are used.  These functions changed semantics in GCC 4.4.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wtrigraphs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX260"></A>
<A NAME="IDX261"></A>
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX262"></A>

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

To suppress this warning use the <SAMP>`unused'</SAMP> attribute
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>).

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused-label</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX268"></A>
<A NAME="IDX269"></A>

</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused-local-typedefs (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>

Warn when a typedef locally defined in a function is not used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused-parameter</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX271"></A>
<A NAME="IDX272"></A>
Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.

To suppress this warning use the <SAMP>`unused'</SAMP> attribute
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-unused-result</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX273"></A>
<A NAME="IDX274"></A>
Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
<CODE>warn_unused_result</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>) does not use
its return value. The default is <SAMP>`-Wunused-result'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused-variable</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX275"></A>
<A NAME="IDX276"></A>
Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused

</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused-value</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX277"></A>
<A NAME="IDX278"></A>
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
used. To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
<SAMP>`void'</SAMP>. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as <SAMP>`x[i,j]'</SAMP> will cause a warning, while
<SAMP>`x[(void)i,j]'</SAMP> will not.
<P>

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX279"></A>
<A NAME="IDX280"></A>
All the above <SAMP>`-Wunused'</SAMP> options combined.
<P>

In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify <SAMP>`-Wextra -Wunused'</SAMP> (note that <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> implies
<SAMP>`-Wunused'</SAMP>), or separately specify <SAMP>`-Wunused-parameter'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wuninitialized</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX281"></A>
<A NAME="IDX282"></A>
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a <CODE>setjmp</CODE> call. In C++,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static <SAMP>`const'</SAMP> member
appears in a class without constructors.
<P>

If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the <SAMP>`-Winit-self'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared <CODE>volatile</CODE>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings will depend on the precise optimization
options and version of GCC used.
</P><P>

Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX283"></A>
<A NAME="IDX284"></A>
For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the function
entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths the variable is not initialized, the compiler will
emit a warning if it can not prove the uninitialized paths do not
happen at run time. These warnings are made optional because GCC is
not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{
  int x;
  switch (y)
    {
    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;
      break;
    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If the value of <CODE>y</CODE> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <CODE>x</CODE> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, the user needs to provide a default case with assert(0) or
similar code.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX285"></A>
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <CODE>longjmp</CODE>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
</P><P>

The compiler sees only the calls to <CODE>setjmp</CODE>.  It cannot know
where <CODE>longjmp</CODE> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <CODE>longjmp</CODE> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
</P><P>

Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <CODE>noreturn</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>.
</P><P>

This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX287"></A>
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
Warn when a <CODE>#pragma</CODE> directive is encountered that is not understood by 
GCC.  If this command-line option is used, warnings will even be issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> command-line option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-pragmas</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX291"></A>
<A NAME="IDX292"></A>
Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
<SAMP>`-Wunknown-pragmas'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-aliasing</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX293"></A>
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
This option is only active when <SAMP>`-fstrict-aliasing'</SAMP> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
It is equivalent to <SAMP>`-Wstrict-aliasing=3'</SAMP>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-aliasing=n</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX295"></A>
<A NAME="IDX296"></A>
This option is only active when <SAMP>`-fstrict-aliasing'</SAMP> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way -O works.
<SAMP>`-Wstrict-aliasing'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`-Wstrict-aliasing=n'</SAMP>,
with n=3.
<P>

Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but -fstrict-aliasing still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
</P><P>

Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
</P><P>

Level 3 (default for <SAMP>`-Wstrict-aliasing'</SAMP>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<CODE>*(int*)&#38;some_float</CODE>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-overflow</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-Wstrict-overflow=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX297"></A>
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
This option is only active when <SAMP>`-fstrict-overflow'</SAMP> is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
<P>

An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
will require, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-overflow=1</CODE>
<DD>Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example: <CODE>x + 1 &#62; x</CODE>; with <SAMP>`-fstrict-overflow'</SAMP>, the
compiler will simplify this to <CODE>1</CODE>.  This level of
<SAMP>`-Wstrict-overflow'</SAMP> is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-overflow=2</CODE>
<DD>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: <CODE>abs (x) &#62;= 0</CODE>.  This can only be
simplified when <SAMP>`-fstrict-overflow'</SAMP> is in effect, because
<CODE>abs (INT_MIN)</CODE> overflows to <CODE>INT_MIN</CODE>, which is less than
zero.  <SAMP>`-Wstrict-overflow'</SAMP> (with no level) is the same as
<SAMP>`-Wstrict-overflow=2'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-overflow=3</CODE>
<DD>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: <CODE>x + 1 &#62; 1</CODE> will be simplified to <CODE>x &#62; 0</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-overflow=4</CODE>
<DD>Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: <CODE>(x * 10) / 5</CODE> will be simplified to <CODE>x * 2</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-overflow=5</CODE>
<DD>Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <CODE>x + 2 &#62; y</CODE> will
be simplified to <CODE>x + 1 &#62;= y</CODE>.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level will give a very large number of
false positives.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsuggest-attribute=[pure|const|noreturn]</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX299"></A>
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial. The
attributes currently supported are listed below.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-Wsuggest-attribute=pure</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-Wsuggest-attribute=const</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX302"></A>
<A NAME="IDX303"></A>
<A NAME="IDX304"></A>
<A NAME="IDX305"></A>
<A NAME="IDX306"></A>
<P>

Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
<CODE>pure</CODE>, <CODE>const</CODE> or <CODE>noreturn</CODE>.  The compiler only warns for
functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of <CODE>pure</CODE> and
<CODE>const</CODE>) if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function
returns normally if it doesn't contain an infinite loop nor returns abnormally
by throwing, calling <CODE>abort()</CODE> or trapping.  This analysis requires option
<SAMP>`-fipa-pure-const'</SAMP>, which is enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> and
higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Warray-bounds</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX307"></A>
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
This option is only active when <SAMP>`-ftree-vrp'</SAMP> is active
(default for <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> and above). It warns about subscripts to arrays
that are always out of bounds. This warning is enabled by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-div-by-zero</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX309"></A>
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating-point
division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of
obtaining infinities and NaNs.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsystem-headers</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells
GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> in conjunction with this
option will <EM>not</EM> warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers--for that, <SAMP>`-Wunknown-pragmas'</SAMP> must also be used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wtrampolines</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
 Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.
<P>

 A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
 time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and
 is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it
 is made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But,
 for most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack
 to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wfloat-equal</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
<P>

The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX319"></A>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in ISO C.
<P>

<LI>
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<SAMP>`-Wtraditional'</SAMP> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<SAMP>`#pragma'</SAMP> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP>, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.
<P>

<LI>
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
<P>

<LI>
The unary plus operator.
<P>

<LI>
The <SAMP>`U'</SAMP> integer constant suffix, or the <SAMP>`F'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`L'</SAMP> floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the <SAMP>`L'</SAMP> suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <SAMP>`_MIN'</SAMP>/<SAMP>`_MAX'</SAMP> macros in <CODE>&#60;limits.h&#62;</CODE>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
<P>

<LI>
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
<P>

<LI>
A <CODE>switch</CODE> statement has an operand of type <CODE>long</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
A non-<CODE>static</CODE> function declaration follows a <CODE>static</CODE> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
<P>

<LI>
The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
<P>

<LI>
Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.
<P>

<LI>
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
<P>

<LI>
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
<P>

<LI>
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
<P>

<LI>
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use <SAMP>`-Wtraditional-conversion'</SAMP>.
<P>

<LI>
Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<EM>not</EM> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <CODE>PARAMS</CODE> and
<CODE>VPARAMS</CODE>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.
</UL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX321"></A>
<A NAME="IDX322"></A>
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX323"></A>
<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from C++, was introduced with ISO C99 and is by default
allowed in GCC.  It is not supported by ISO C90 and was not supported by
GCC versions before GCC 3.0.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC85">6.29 Mixed Declarations and Code</A>.

<DD><A NAME="IDX327"></A>
<A NAME="IDX328"></A>

<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wshadow</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX329"></A>
<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable,
parameter, type, or class member (in C++), or whenever a built-in function
is shadowed. Note that in C++, the compiler will not warn if a local variable
shadows a struct/class/enum, but will warn if it shadows an explicit typedef.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wlarger-than=<VAR>len</VAR></CODE>

<DT><CODE>-Wframe-larger-than=<VAR>len</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX333"></A>
Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than <VAR>len</VAR> bytes.
The computation done to determine the stack frame size is approximate
and not conservative.
The actual requirements may be somewhat greater than <VAR>len</VAR>
even if you do not get a warning.  In addition, any space allocated

Warn if the stack usage of a function might be larger than <VAR>len</VAR> bytes.
The computation done to determine the stack usage is conservative.
Any space allocated via <CODE>alloca</CODE>, variable-length arrays, or related

<DT><CODE>-Wpointer-arith</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX341"></A>
<A NAME="IDX342"></A>
Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type or

convenience in calculations with <CODE>void *</CODE> pointers and pointers
to functions.  In C++, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves

Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the limited

<DT><CODE>-Wc++11-compat (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD>Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++ 1998

Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from

to an ordinary <CODE>char *</CODE>.
<P>

Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an
unsafe way.  For example, casting <CODE>char **</CODE> to <CODE>const char **</CODE>
is unsafe, as in this example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  /* p is char ** value.  */

<DT><CODE>-Wwrite-strings</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX351"></A>
<A NAME="IDX352"></A>
When compiling C, give string constants the type <CODE>const
char[<VAR>length</VAR>]</CODE> so that copying the address of one into a
non-<CODE>const</CODE> <CODE>char *</CODE> pointer will get a warning.  These
warnings will help you find at compile time code that can try to write
into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about
using <CODE>const</CODE> in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will
just be a nuisance. This is why we did not make <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> request
these warnings.

<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wconversion</CODE>

Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This includes
conversions between real and integer, like <CODE>abs (x)</CODE> when
<CODE>x</CODE> is <CODE>double</CODE>; conversions between signed and unsigned,
like <CODE>unsigned ui = -1</CODE>; and conversions to smaller types, like
<CODE>sqrtf (M_PI)</CODE>. Do not warn for explicit casts like <CODE>abs
((int) x)</CODE> and <CODE>ui = (unsigned) -1</CODE>, or if the value is not
changed by the conversion like in <CODE>abs (2.0)</CODE>.  Warnings about
conversions between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by
using <SAMP>`-Wno-sign-conversion'</SAMP>.
<P>

For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined
conversions; and conversions that will never use a type conversion
operator: conversions to <CODE>void</CODE>, the same type, a base class or a
reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and
unsigned integers are disabled by default in C++ unless

<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wjump-misses-init (C, Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX365"></A>
<A NAME="IDX366"></A>
Warn if a <CODE>goto</CODE> statement or a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement jumps
forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a
label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns about
variables that are initialized when they are declared.  This warning is
only supported for C and Objective-C; in C++ this sort of branch is an
error in any case.
<P>

<SAMP>`-Wjump-misses-init'</SAMP> is included in <SAMP>`-Wc++-compat'</SAMP>.  It

Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>; to get the other warnings

<DD><A NAME="IDX372"></A>
<A NAME="IDX373"></A>
Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer

integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this
option is enabled also by <SAMP>`-Wconversion'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Waddress</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX374"></A>
<A NAME="IDX375"></A>
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
<CODE>void func(void); if (func)</CODE>, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as <CODE>if (x == "abc")</CODE>.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use <CODE>strcmp</CODE>.  This warning is enabled by
<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wlogical-op</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX376"></A>
<A NAME="IDX377"></A>
Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
This includes using logical operators in contexts where a
bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Waggregate-return</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX378"></A>
<A NAME="IDX379"></A>
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or

a warning.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-attributes</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX380"></A>
<A NAME="IDX381"></A>
Do not warn if an unexpected <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> is used, such as

attributes.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX382"></A>
<A NAME="IDX383"></A>
Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This suppresses

types.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wold-style-declaration (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX386"></A>
<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a
declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers like
<CODE>static</CODE> are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning
is also enabled by <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wold-style-definition (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX388"></A>
<A NAME="IDX389"></A>
Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX390"></A>
<A NAME="IDX391"></A>
A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&#38;R-style
functions:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void foo(bar) { }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This warning is also enabled by <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX392"></A>
<A NAME="IDX393"></A>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that 
are not declared in header files.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-declarations</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX394"></A>
<A NAME="IDX395"></A>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C++, no warnings are issued for function templates,
or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-field-initializers</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX396"></A>
<A NAME="IDX397"></A>
<A NAME="IDX398"></A>
<A NAME="IDX399"></A>
<A NAME="IDX400"></A>
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
<CODE>x.h</CODE> is implicitly zero:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct s { int f, g, h; };
struct s x = { 3, 4 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification would not trigger a warning:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct s { int f, g, h; };
struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This warning is included in <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>.  To get other <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>
warnings without this one, use <SAMP>`-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-format-attribute</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX401"></A>
<A NAME="IDX402"></A>
<A NAME="IDX403"></A>
<A NAME="IDX404"></A>
Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for <CODE>format</CODE>
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
GCC will guess that function pointers with <CODE>format</CODE> attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding <CODE>format</CODE> attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a <CODE>format</CODE>
attribute to avoid the warning.
<P>

GCC will also warn about function definitions that might be
candidates for <CODE>format</CODE> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC will guess that <CODE>format</CODE> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
<CODE>vprintf</CODE> or <CODE>vscanf</CODE>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which <CODE>format</CODE> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-multichar</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX405"></A>
<A NAME="IDX406"></A>
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<SAMP>`'FOOF''</SAMP>) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnormalized=&#60;none|id|nfc|nfkc&#62;</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX407"></A>
<A NAME="IDX408"></A>
<A NAME="IDX409"></A>
<A NAME="IDX410"></A>
In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <EM>normalization rules</EM> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
<P>

There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<SAMP>`-Wnormalized=nfc'</SAMP>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, <EM>NFC</EM>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.
</P><P>

Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
<SAMP>`-Wnormalized=id'</SAMP> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
</P><P>

You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<SAMP>`-Wnormalized=none'</SAMP>.  You would only want to do this if you
were using some other normalization scheme (like "D"), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.
</P><P>

Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <CODE>\u207F</CODE>, "SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N", will display just like a regular <CODE>n</CODE> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <EM>NFKC</EM>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC will warn if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<SAMP>`-Wnormalized=nfkc'</SAMP>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment is
unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-deprecated</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX411"></A>
<A NAME="IDX412"></A>
Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC145">7.11 Deprecated Features</A>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX413"></A>
<A NAME="IDX414"></A>
Do not warn about uses of functions (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>),
variables (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>), and types (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC93">6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types</A>) marked as deprecated by using the <CODE>deprecated</CODE>
attribute.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-overflow</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX415"></A>
<A NAME="IDX416"></A>
Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Woverride-init (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX417"></A>
<A NAME="IDX418"></A>
<A NAME="IDX419"></A>
<A NAME="IDX420"></A>
<A NAME="IDX421"></A>
Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC82">Designated Initializers</A>).
<P>

This warning is included in <SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP>.  To get other
<SAMP>`-Wextra'</SAMP> warnings without this one, use <SAMP>`-Wextra
-Wno-override-init'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wpacked</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX422"></A>
<A NAME="IDX423"></A>
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <CODE>f.x</CODE> in <CODE>struct bar</CODE>
will be misaligned even though <CODE>struct bar</CODE> does not itself
have the packed attribute:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct foo {
  int x;
  char a, b, c, d;
} __attribute__((packed));
struct bar {
  char z;
  struct foo f;
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wpacked-bitfield-compat</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX424"></A>
<A NAME="IDX425"></A>
The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute
on bit-fields of type <CODE>char</CODE>.  This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.
For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field <CODE>a</CODE>
and <CODE>b</CODE> in this structure:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct foo
{
  char a:4;
  char b:8;
} __attribute__ ((packed));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This warning is enabled by default.  Use
<SAMP>`-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat'</SAMP> to disable this warning.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wpadded</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX426"></A>
<A NAME="IDX427"></A>
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wredundant-decls</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX428"></A>
<A NAME="IDX429"></A>
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX430"></A>
<A NAME="IDX431"></A>
Warn if an <CODE>extern</CODE> declaration is encountered within a function.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Winline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX432"></A>
<A NAME="IDX433"></A>
Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline.
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
<P>

The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <SAMP>`-Winline'</SAMP> to appear or disappear.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-invalid-offsetof (C++ and Objective-C++ only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX434"></A>
<A NAME="IDX435"></A>
Suppress warnings from applying the <SAMP>`offsetof'</SAMP> macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying <SAMP>`offsetof'</SAMP>
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
however, <SAMP>`offsetof'</SAMP> typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
<SAMP>`struct'</SAMP> that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.
<P>

The restrictions on <SAMP>`offsetof'</SAMP> may be relaxed in a future version
of the C++ standard.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX436"></A>
<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size. In C++, casting to a pointer type of smaller size is
an error. <SAMP>`Wint-to-pointer-cast'</SAMP> is enabled by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX438"></A>
<A NAME="IDX439"></A>
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Winvalid-pch</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX440"></A>
<A NAME="IDX441"></A>
Warn if a precompiled header (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC33">3.20 Using Precompiled Headers</A>) is found in
the search path but can't be used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wlong-long</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX442"></A>
<A NAME="IDX443"></A>
Warn if <SAMP>`long long'</SAMP> type is used.  This is enabled by either
<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-Wtraditional'</SAMP> in ISO C90 and C++98
modes.  To inhibit the warning messages, use <SAMP>`-Wno-long-long'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wvariadic-macros</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX444"></A>
<A NAME="IDX445"></A>
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic ISO C90 mode, or the GNU
alternate syntax when in pedantic ISO C99 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use <SAMP>`-Wno-variadic-macros'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wvector-operation-performance</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX446"></A>
<A NAME="IDX447"></A>
Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented <CODE>piecewise</CODE>, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
<CODE>in parallel</CODE>, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and <CODE>as a single scalar</CODE>, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wvla</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX448"></A>
<A NAME="IDX449"></A>
Warn if variable length array is used in the code.
<SAMP>`-Wno-vla'</SAMP> will prevent the <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> warning of
the variable length array.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wvolatile-register-var</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX450"></A>
<A NAME="IDX451"></A>
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled by
<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wdisabled-optimization</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX452"></A>
<A NAME="IDX453"></A>
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC's optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX454"></A>
<A NAME="IDX455"></A>
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> and by <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>, which can be disabled with
<SAMP>`-Wno-pointer-sign'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstack-protector</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX456"></A>
<A NAME="IDX457"></A>
This option is only active when <SAMP>`-fstack-protector'</SAMP> is active.  It
warns about functions that will not be protected against stack smashing.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-mudflap</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX458"></A>
Suppress warnings about constructs that cannot be instrumented by
<SAMP>`-fmudflap'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Woverlength-strings</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX460"></A>
Warn about string constants that are longer than the "minimum
maximum" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
<P>

The limit applies <EM>after</EM> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.
</P><P>

This option is implied by <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>, and can be disabled with
<SAMP>`-Wno-overlength-strings'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX461"></A>
<P>

GCC will issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with <SAMP>`-Wsystem-headers'</SAMP> it will
warn about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the <CODE>FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64</CODE> pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.

<H2> 3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC </H2>
<!--docid::SEC17::-->
<P>

GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-g</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX462"></A>
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.
<P>

On most systems that use stabs format, <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <SAMP>`-gstabs+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-gxcoff+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-gxcoff'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-gvms'</SAMP> (see below).
</P><P>

GCC allows you to use <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> with
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
</P><P>

Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
</P><P>

The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ggdb</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX463"></A>
Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gstabs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX464"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by DBX or SDB.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX465"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-femit-class-debug-always</CODE>
<DD>Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option will increase the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-debug-types-section</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX466"></A>
<A NAME="IDX467"></A>
By default when using DWARF v4 or higher type DIEs will be put into
their own .debug_types section instead of making them part of the
.debug_info section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker will then be able to remove duplicates.
But not all DWARF consumers support .debug_types sections yet.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gstabs+</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX468"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gcoff</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX469"></A>
Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gxcoff</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX470"></A>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gxcoff+</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX471"></A>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gdwarf-<VAR>version</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX472"></A>
Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6.  The value
of <VAR>version</VAR> may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default version is 2.
<P>

Note that with DWARF version 2 some ports require, and will always
use, some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.
</P><P>

Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <SAMP>`-fvar-tracking-assignments'</SAMP>
for maximum benefit.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-grecord-gcc-switches</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX473"></A>
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  See also <SAMP>`-frecord-gcc-switches'</SAMP> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gno-record-gcc-switches</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX474"></A>
Disallow appending command-line options to the DW_AT_producer attribute
in DWARF debugging information.  This is the default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gstrict-dwarf</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX475"></A>
Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected
with <SAMP>`-gdwarf-<VAR>version</VAR>'</SAMP>.  On most targets using non-conflicting
DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gno-strict-dwarf</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX476"></A>
Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with
<SAMP>`-gdwarf-<VAR>version</VAR>'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gvms</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX477"></A>
Produce debugging information in VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on VMS systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-g<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-ggdb<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gstabs<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gcoff<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gxcoff<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gvms<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Request debugging information and also use <VAR>level</VAR> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
<P>

Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <SAMP>`-g0'</SAMP> negates
<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
</P><P>

Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <SAMP>`-g3'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-gdwarf-2'</SAMP> does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
GCC used to support an option <SAMP>`-gdwarf'</SAMP> that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional <SAMP>`-g<VAR>level</VAR>'</SAMP> option to change the
debug level for DWARF.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-gtoggle</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX478"></A>
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option would have
generated it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter, it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
<SAMP>`-fcompare-debug'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdump-final-insns[=<VAR>file</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX479"></A>
Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to <VAR>file</VAR>.  If the
optional argument is omitted (or if <VAR>file</VAR> is <CODE>.</CODE>), the name
of the dump file will be determined by appending <CODE>.gkd</CODE> to the
compilation output file name.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcompare-debug[=<VAR>opts</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX480"></A>
<A NAME="IDX481"></A>
If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding <VAR>opts</VAR> and <SAMP>`-fcompare-debug-second'</SAMP> to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.
<P>

If the equal sign is omitted, the default <SAMP>`-gtoggle'</SAMP> is used.
</P><P>

The environment variable <CODE>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</CODE>, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables <SAMP>`-fcompare-debug'</SAMP>.  If
<CODE>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</CODE> is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for <VAR>opts</VAR>, otherwise the default <SAMP>`-gtoggle'</SAMP>
is used.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-fcompare-debug='</SAMP>, with the equal sign but without <VAR>opts</VAR>,
is equivalent to <SAMP>`-fno-compare-debug'</SAMP>, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
<CODE>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</CODE> from taking effect.
</P><P>

To verify full coverage during <SAMP>`-fcompare-debug'</SAMP> testing, set
<CODE>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</CODE> to say <SAMP>`-fcompare-debug-not-overridden'</SAMP>,
which GCC will reject as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting <CODE>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</CODE> to <SAMP>`-w%n-fcompare-debug
not overridden'</SAMP> will do.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fcompare-debug-second</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX482"></A>
This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
compilation requested by <SAMP>`-fcompare-debug'</SAMP>, along with options to
silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
<CODE>.gk</CODE> additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.
<P>

When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
<EM>first</EM> compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
other than debugging the compiler proper.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-feliminate-dwarf2-dups</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX483"></A>
Compress DWARF2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating DWARF2 debugging information with <SAMP>`-gdwarf-2'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</CODE>
<DD>Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the struct was defined.
<P>

This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information,
but at significant potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See <SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-reduced'</SAMP> for a less aggressive option.
See <SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-detailed'</SAMP> for more detailed control.
</P><P>

This option works only with DWARF 2.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</CODE>
<DD>Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the type was defined,
unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header.
<P>

This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information,
with some potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See <SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-baseonly'</SAMP> for a more aggressive option.
See <SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-detailed'</SAMP> for more detailed control.
</P><P>

This option works only with DWARF 2.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=<VAR>spec-list</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler will generate debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.
<P>

This option is a detailed version of
<SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-reduced'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-baseonly'</SAMP>,
which will serve for most needs.
</P><P>

A specification has the syntax<BR>
[<SAMP>`dir:'</SAMP>|<SAMP>`ind:'</SAMP>][<SAMP>`ord:'</SAMP>|<SAMP>`gen:'</SAMP>](<SAMP>`any'</SAMP>|<SAMP>`sys'</SAMP>|<SAMP>`base'</SAMP>|<SAMP>`none'</SAMP>)
</P><P>

The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (<SAMP>`dir:'</SAMP>) or used indirectly (<SAMP>`ind:'</SAMP>).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct would be legal, the use is indirect.
An example is
<SAMP>`struct one direct; struct two * indirect;'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (<SAMP>`ord:'</SAMP>) or generic structs (<SAMP>`gen:'</SAMP>).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For C++, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but <SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-detailed'</SAMP> does not yet implement them.
</P><P>

The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler will emit debug information.
The values <SAMP>`none'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`any'</SAMP> have the normal meaning.
The value <SAMP>`base'</SAMP> means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that
types declared in <TT>`foo.c'</TT> and <TT>`foo.h'</TT> will have debug information,
but types declared in other header will not.
The value <SAMP>`sys'</SAMP> means those types satisfying <SAMP>`base'</SAMP>
or declared in system or compiler headers.
</P><P>

You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.
</P><P>

The default is <SAMP>`-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

This option works only with DWARF 2.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-merge-debug-strings</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX484"></A>
<A NAME="IDX485"></A>
Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
information that are identical in different object files.  Merging is
not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging decreases the size
of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing
link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdebug-prefix-map=<VAR>old</VAR>=<VAR>new</VAR></CODE>

<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstack-usage</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX498"></A>
Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
<TT>`.su'</TT> to the <VAR>auxname</VAR>.  <VAR>auxname</VAR> is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
The name of the function.
<LI>
A number of bytes.
<LI>
One or more qualifiers: <CODE>static</CODE>, <CODE>dynamic</CODE>, <CODE>bounded</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>

The qualifier <CODE>static</CODE> means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.
</P><P>

The qualifier <CODE>dynamic</CODE> means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier <CODE>bounded</CODE> is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fprofile-arcs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX499"></A>
Add code so that program flow <EM>arcs</EM> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<TT>`<VAR>auxname</VAR>.gcda'</TT> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<SAMP>`-fbranch-probabilities'</SAMP>), or for
test coverage analysis (<SAMP>`-ftest-coverage'</SAMP>).  Each object file's
<VAR>auxname</VAR> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <TT>`foo.gcda'</TT> for input file <TT>`dir/foo.c'</TT>, or
<TT>`dir/foo.gcda'</TT> for output file specified as <SAMP>`-o dir/foo.o'</SAMP>).
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC176">10.5 Data file relocation to support cross-profiling</A>.

<A NAME="IDX500"></A>
<DT><CODE>--coverage</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX501"></A>
<P>

This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>
<SAMP>`-ftest-coverage'</SAMP> (when compiling) and <SAMP>`-lgcov'</SAMP> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
Compile the source files with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <SAMP>`-ftest-coverage'</SAMP> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.
<P>

<LI>
Link your object files with <SAMP>`-lgcov'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>
(the latter implies the former).
<P>

<LI>
Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
<CODE>fork</CODE> calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).
<P>

<LI>
For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<SAMP>`-fbranch-probabilities'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC18">Options that Control Optimization</A>).
<P>

<LI>
For test coverage analysis, use <CODE>gcov</CODE> to produce human readable
information from the <TT>`.gcno'</TT> and <TT>`.gcda'</TT> files.  Refer to the
<CODE>gcov</CODE> documentation for further information.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

With <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ftest-coverage</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX502"></A>
Produce a notes file that the <CODE>gcov</CODE> code-coverage utility
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC171"><CODE>gcov</CODE>---a Test Coverage Program</A>) can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
<TT>`<VAR>auxname</VAR>.gcno'</TT>.  Refer to the <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP> option
above for a description of <VAR>auxname</VAR> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data will match the source files
more closely, if you do not optimize.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdbg-cnt-list</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX503"></A>
Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdbg-cnt=<VAR>counter-value-list</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX504"></A>
Set the internal debug counter upper bound.  <VAR>counter-value-list</VAR>
is a comma-separated list of <VAR>name</VAR>:<VAR>value</VAR> pairs
which sets the upper bound of each debug counter <VAR>name</VAR> to <VAR>value</VAR>.
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of <VAR>UINT_MAX</VAR>,
thus dbg_cnt() returns true always unless the upper bound is set by this option.
e.g. With -fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0
dbg_cnt(dce) will return true only for first 10 invocations

appended with a sequential number starting from 1.  <VAR>range-list</VAR> is a comma
seperated list of function ranges or assembler names.  Each range is a number
pair seperated by a colon.  The range is inclusive in both ends.  If the range
is trivial, the number pair can be simplified as a single number.  If the
function's cgraph node's <VAR>uid</VAR> is falling within one of the specified ranges,
the <VAR>pass</VAR> is disabled for that function.  The <VAR>uid</VAR> is shown in the

<DT><CODE>-d<VAR>letters</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fdump-rtl-<VAR>pass</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX507"></A>
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<VAR>letters</VAR>.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending
a pass number and a word to the <VAR>dumpname</VAR>, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file.  Note that the pass
number is computed statically as passes get registered into the pass
manager.  Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of
execution of passes.  In particular, a pass installed by a plugin
could have a number over 200 even if it executed quite early.
<VAR>dumpname</VAR> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the
basename of the source file. These switches may have different effects
when <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> is used for preprocessing.
<P>

Debug dumps can be enabled with a <SAMP>`-fdump-rtl'</SAMP> switch or some

</DL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX621"></A>
This option controls the amount of debugging output the vectorizer prints.
This information is written to standard error, unless
<SAMP>`-fdump-tree-all'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-fdump-tree-vect'</SAMP> is specified,
in which case it is output to the usual dump listing file, <TT>`.vect'</TT>.
For <VAR>n</VAR>=0 no diagnostic information is reported.
If <VAR>n</VAR>=1 the vectorizer reports each loop that got vectorized,
and the total number of loops that got vectorized.
If <VAR>n</VAR>=2 the vectorizer also reports non-vectorized loops that passed
the first analysis phase (vect_analyze_loop_form) - i.e. countable,
inner-most, single-bb, single-entry/exit loops.  This is the same verbosity
level that <SAMP>`-fdump-tree-vect-stats'</SAMP> uses.
Higher verbosity levels mean either more information dumped for each
reported loop, or same amount of information reported for more loops:
if <VAR>n</VAR>=3, vectorizer cost model information is reported.
If <VAR>n</VAR>=4, alignment related information is added to the reports.
If <VAR>n</VAR>=5, data-references related information (e.g. memory dependences,
memory access-patterns) is added to the reports.
If <VAR>n</VAR>=6, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized inner-most loops
that did not pass the first analysis phase (i.e., may not be countable, or
may have complicated control-flow).
If <VAR>n</VAR>=7, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized nested loops.
If <VAR>n</VAR>=8, SLP related information is added to the reports.
For <VAR>n</VAR>=9, all the information the vectorizer generates during its
analysis and transformation is reported.  This is the same verbosity level
that <SAMP>`-fdump-tree-vect-details'</SAMP> uses.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-frandom-seed=<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX622"></A>
This option provides a seed that GCC uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the <SAMP>`-frandom-seed'</SAMP> option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.
<P>

The <VAR>string</VAR> should be different for every file you compile.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsched-verbose=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX623"></A>
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless <SAMP>`-fdump-rtl-sched1'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-fdump-rtl-sched2'</SAMP> is specified, in which case it is output
to the usual dump listing file, <TT>`.sched1'</TT> or <TT>`.sched2'</TT>
respectively.  However for <VAR>n</VAR> greater than nine, the output is
always printed to standard error.
<P>

For <VAR>n</VAR> greater than zero, <SAMP>`-fsched-verbose'</SAMP> outputs the
same information as <SAMP>`-fdump-rtl-sched1'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fdump-rtl-sched2'</SAMP>.
For <VAR>n</VAR> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For <VAR>n</VAR> greater
than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions info.
And for <VAR>n</VAR> over four, <SAMP>`-fsched-verbose'</SAMP> also includes
dependence info.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-save-temps</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-save-temps=cwd</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX624"></A>
Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <TT>`foo.c'</TT> with <SAMP>`-c -save-temps'</SAMP> would produce files
<TT>`foo.i'</TT> and <TT>`foo.s'</TT>, as well as <TT>`foo.o'</TT>.  This creates a
preprocessed <TT>`foo.i'</TT> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
<P>

When used in combination with the <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> command-line option,
<SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using <SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&#38;
gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&#38;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

may result in <TT>`foo.i'</TT> and <TT>`foo.o'</TT> being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-save-temps=obj</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX625"></A>
Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently.  If the
<SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option is not used, the
<SAMP>`-save-temps=obj'</SAMP> switch behaves like <SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>.
<P>

For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

would create <TT>`foo.i'</TT>, <TT>`foo.s'</TT>, <TT>`dir/xbar.i'</TT>,
<TT>`dir/xbar.s'</TT>, <TT>`dir2/yfoobar.i'</TT>, <TT>`dir2/yfoobar.s'</TT>, and
<TT>`dir2/yfoobar.o'</TT>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-time[=<VAR>file</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX626"></A>
Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).
<P>

Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fvar-tracking</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX627"></A>
Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each
position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated
(if the debugging information format supports this information).
<P>

It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>, <small>...</small>), debugging information (<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>) and
the debug info format supports it.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fvar-tracking-assignments</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX628"></A>
<A NAME="IDX629"></A>
Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and
attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the
way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while
optimizing.  Use of <SAMP>`-gdwarf-4'</SAMP> is recommended along with it.
<P>

It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case
annotations will be created and maintained, but discarded at the end.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX630"></A>
<A NAME="IDX631"></A>
Toggle <SAMP>`-fvar-tracking-assignments'</SAMP>, in the same way that
<SAMP>`-gtoggle'</SAMP> toggles <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-print-file-name=<VAR>library</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX632"></A>
Print the full absolute name of the library file <VAR>library</VAR> that
would be used when linking--and don't do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-print-multi-directory</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX633"></A>
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-print-multi-lib</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX634"></A>
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>, and each switch starts with an <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> instead of the
<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell-processing.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-print-multi-os-directory</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX635"></A>
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some <TT>`lib'</TT> subdirectory.  If OS libraries are
present in the <TT>`lib'</TT> subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just <TT>`.'</TT>, if OS libraries are present in <TT>`lib<VAR>suffix</VAR>'</TT>
sibling directories this prints e.g. <TT>`../lib64'</TT>, <TT>`../lib'</TT> or
<TT>`../lib32'</TT>, or if OS libraries are present in <TT>`lib/<VAR>subdir</VAR>'</TT>
subdirectories it prints e.g. <TT>`amd64'</TT>, <TT>`sparcv9'</TT> or <TT>`ev6'</TT>.

<DD><A NAME="IDX638"></A>
Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories <CODE>gcc</CODE> will search--and don't do anything else.
<P>

This is useful when <CODE>gcc</CODE> prints the error message
<SAMP>`installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory'</SAMP>.
To resolve this you either need to put <TT>`cpp0'</TT> and the other compiler
components where <CODE>gcc</CODE> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> to the directory where you installed them.
Don't forget the trailing <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC32">3.19 Environment Variables Affecting GCC</A>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-print-sysroot</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX639"></A>
Print the target sysroot directory that will be used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX640"></A>
Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such
a suffix--and don't do anything else.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-dumpmachine</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX641"></A>
Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
<SAMP>`i686-pc-linux-gnu'</SAMP>)---and don't do anything else.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-dumpversion</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX642"></A>
Print the compiler version (for example, <SAMP>`3.0'</SAMP>)---and don't do
anything else.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-dumpspecs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX643"></A>
Print the compiler's built-in specs--and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when GCC itself is being built.)  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC23">3.15 Specifying subprocesses and the switches to pass to them</A>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-feliminate-unused-debug-types</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX644"></A>
Normally, when producing DWARF2 output, GCC will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
With this option, GCC will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.

<H2> 3.10 Options That Control Optimization </H2>
<!--docid::SEC18::-->
<P>

These options control various sorts of optimizations.
</P><P>

Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
</P><P>

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
</P><P>

The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
</P><P>

Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
</P><P>

Most optimizations are only enabled if an <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.
</P><P>

Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <SAMP>`-Q --help=optimizers'</SAMP>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC10">3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</A>, for examples.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-O</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-O1</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX645"></A>
<A NAME="IDX646"></A>
Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
<P>

With <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> turns on the following optimization flags:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{

<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> also turns on <SAMP>`-fomit-frame-pointer'</SAMP> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-O2</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX647"></A>
Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
<P>

<SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> turns on all optimization flags specified by <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:

<DT><CODE>-O3</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX648"></A>
Optimize yet more.  <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP> turns on all optimizations specified

<SAMP>`-funswitch-loops'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-fpredictive-commoning'</SAMP>,

Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Os</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX650"></A>
Optimize for size.  <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP> enables all <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size. It enables option <SAMP>`-fsort-data'</SAMP>.

</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Ofast</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX651"></A>
Disregard strict standards compliance.  <SAMP>`-Ofast'</SAMP> enables all
<SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard compliant programs.
It turns on <SAMP>`-ffast-math'</SAMP> and the Fortran-specific
<SAMP>`-fno-protect-parens'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fstack-arrays'</SAMP>.
<P>

If you use multiple <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</DL>
<P>

Options of the form <SAMP>`-f<VAR>flag</VAR>'</SAMP> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed--the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing <SAMP>`no-'</SAMP>
or adding it.
</P><P>

The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning" of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fno-default-inline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX652"></A>
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add <SAMP>`inline'</SAMP> in front of
the member function name.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-defer-pop</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX653"></A>
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines that must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
<P>

Disabled at levels <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fforward-propagate</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX654"></A>
Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.
<P>

This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ffp-contract=<VAR>style</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX655"></A>
<SAMP>`-ffp-contract=off'</SAMP> disables floating-point expression contraction.
<SAMP>`-ffp-contract=fast'</SAMP> enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
<SAMP>`-ffp-contract=on'</SAMP> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to <SAMP>`-ffp-contract=off'</SAMP>.
<P>

The default is <SAMP>`-ffp-contract=fast'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX656"></A>
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <STRONG>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</STRONG>
<P>

On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See section `Register Usage' in <CITE>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals</CITE>.
</P><P>

Starting with GCC version 4.6, the default setting (when not optimizing for
size) for 32-bit Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets has been changed to
<SAMP>`-fomit-frame-pointer'</SAMP>.  The default can be reverted to
<SAMP>`-fno-omit-frame-pointer'</SAMP> by configuring GCC with the
<SAMP>`--enable-frame-pointer'</SAMP> configure option.

</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-inline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX658"></A>
Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with
the <CODE>always_inline</CODE> attribute.  This is the default when not
optimizing.
<P>

Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them
with the <CODE>noinline</CODE> attribute.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finline-small-functions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX659"></A>
Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.  This inlining applies to all functions, even those not declared
inline.
<P>

Enabled at level <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-findirect-inlining</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX660"></A>
Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile
time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`-finline-small-functions'</SAMP> options.
<P>

Enabled at level <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finline-functions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX661"></A>
Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not declared inline.
The compiler heuristically decides which functions are worth integrating
in this way.
<P>

If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <CODE>static</CODE>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.
</P><P>

Enabled at level <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsort-data</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX662"></A>
Sorts initialized data variables and constant data based on their alignment
and place in seperate sections. The N(1/2/4) byte aligned data will be placed
either in section ".data.alignN" or in ".rodata.alignN" depending on readonly
attribute. The COFF tool chain ignores this option. This option will be
ignored if used along with option <SAMP>`-fdata-sections'</SAMP>.
<P>

Enabled at level <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>. 
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finline-functions-called-once</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX663"></A>
Consider all <CODE>static</CODE> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <CODE>inline</CODE>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.
<P>

Enabled at levels <SAMP>`-O1'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fearly-inlining</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX664"></A>
Inline functions marked by <CODE>always_inline</CODE> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<SAMP>`-fprofile-generate'</SAMP> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.
<P>

Enabled by default.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fipa-sra</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX665"></A>
Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal of
unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference
by parameters passed by value.
<P>

Enabled at levels <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finline-limit=<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX666"></A>
By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  <VAR>n</VAR> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.
<P>

Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <SAMP>`--param <VAR>name</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR>'</SAMP>.
The <SAMP>`-finline-limit=<VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>max-inline-insns-single</CODE>
<DD>is set to <VAR>n</VAR>/2.
<DT><CODE>max-inline-insns-auto</CODE>
<DD>is set to <VAR>n</VAR>/2.
</DL>
<P>

See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.
</P><P>

<EM>Note:</EM> there may be no value to <SAMP>`-finline-limit'</SAMP> that results
in default behavior.
</P><P>

<EM>Note:</EM> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX667"></A>
This is a more fine-grained version of <SAMP>`-fkeep-inline-functions'</SAMP>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the <CODE>dllexport</CODE>
attribute or declspec (See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fkeep-inline-functions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX668"></A>
In C, emit <CODE>static</CODE> functions that are declared <CODE>inline</CODE>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<CODE>extern inline</CODE> extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fkeep-static-consts</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX669"></A>
Emit variables declared <CODE>static const</CODE> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.
<P>

GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <SAMP>`-fno-keep-static-consts'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fmerge-constants</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX670"></A>
Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.
<P>

This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <SAMP>`-fno-merge-constants'</SAMP> to inhibit this
behavior.

<DT><CODE>-fmerge-all-constants</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX671"></A>
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
<P>

This option implies <SAMP>`-fmerge-constants'</SAMP>.  In addition to
<SAMP>`-fmerge-constants'</SAMP> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,

<DT><CODE>-fmodulo-sched</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX672"></A>
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling

instructions by overlapping different iterations.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX673"></A>
Perform more aggressive SMS based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges will be
deleted which will trigger the generation of reg-moves based on the

<DT><CODE>-fno-branch-count-reg</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX674"></A>
Do not use "decrement and branch" instructions on a count register,

Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that

If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that

For front-ends that support it (C and C++), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C++
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (<TT>`libmudflap'</TT>), which will be linked into a program if
<SAMP>`-fmudflap'</SAMP> is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the <CODE>MUDFLAP_OPTIONS</CODE>
environment variable.  See <CODE>env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out</CODE>
for its options.
<P>

Use <SAMP>`-fmudflapth'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`-fmudflap'</SAMP> to compile and to
link if your program is multi-threaded.  Use <SAMP>`-fmudflapir'</SAMP>, in
addition to <SAMP>`-fmudflap'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-fmudflapth'</SAMP>, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides
some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows
erroneously read data to propagate within a program.

In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions

When <SAMP>`-fgcse-lm'</SAMP> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination will
attempt to move loads that are only killed by stores into themselves.  This

Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple constant

analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.

<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-fre</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX738"></A>
Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> and higher.

compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fipa-profile</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX744"></A>
Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
<CODE>cold</CODE>, <CODE>noreturn</CODE>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> and higher.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fipa-cp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX745"></A>
Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fipa-cp-clone</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX746"></A>
Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation will perform function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see <SAMP>`--param ipcp-unit-growth=<VAR>value</VAR>'</SAMP>).

Perform matrix flattening and transposing.
Matrix flattening tries to replace an <EM>m</EM>-dimensional matrix
with its equivalent <EM>n</EM>-dimensional matrix, where <EM>n &#60; m</EM>.
This reduces the level of indirection needed for accessing the elements
of the matrix. The second optimization is matrix transposing, which
attempts to change the order of the matrix's dimensions in order to
improve cache locality.
Both optimizations need the <SAMP>`-fwhole-program'</SAMP> flag.
Transposing is enabled only if profiling information is available.

<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-dse</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX754"></A>
Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without

flag is enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> and higher.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-ch</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX755"></A>
Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag

<P>

<DT><CODE>-floop-interchange</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX758"></A>
Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging two
nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example, given a

because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This optimization
applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is not limited to
Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has to be configured

Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
using the <SAMP>`loop-block-tile-size'</SAMP> parameter.  For example,
given a loop like:

Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the

<DT><CODE>-floop-flatten</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX762"></A>
Removes the loop nesting structure: transforms the loop nest into a

transform for vectorization and parallelization.  This feature
is experimental.
To use this code transformation, GCC has to be configured

<DT><CODE>-ftree-loop-if-convert-stores</CODE>
<DD>Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing memory writes.
This transformation can be unsafe for multi-threaded programs as it

<DD><A NAME="IDX765"></A>
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
would be hard to handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With <SAMP>`-funswitch-loops'</SAMP> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX766"></A>
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which

Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX768"></A>
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option

<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-copyrename</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX771"></A>
Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler

variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> and higher.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftree-ter</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX772"></A>
Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA-&#62;normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL generation.  This is
enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> and higher.

<DT><CODE>-ftree-vect-loop-version</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX775"></A>
Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop
appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence cannot
be determined at compile time, then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with run-time checks for alignment or dependence
to control which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default

<DT><CODE>-ftree-vrp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX777"></A>
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if <SAMP>`-fdelete-null-pointer-checks'</SAMP> is
enabled.

Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  <SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP> implies

<P>

<DT><CODE>-funroll-all-loops</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX780"></A>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
<SAMP>`-funroll-all-loops'</SAMP> implies the same options as
<SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP>,
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX781"></A>
Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
<P>

Combination of <SAMP>`-fweb'</SAMP> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However in cases the loop body is more complicated than
a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not work at all
on some of the architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.

<DT><CODE>-fno-guess-branch-probability</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX788"></A>
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
<P>

GCC will use heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (<SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by <SAMP>`__builtin_expect'</SAMP>, then the heuristics will be
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the <SAMP>`__builtin_expect'</SAMP> info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and <SAMP>`__builtin_expect'</SAMP> can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of <SAMP>`__builtin_expect'</SAMP> are easier to understand.

Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections <CODE>.text.hot</CODE> for most frequently executed functions and
<CODE>.text.unlikely</CODE> for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by

optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> can alias an <CODE>int</CODE>, but not a
<CODE>void*</CODE> or a <CODE>double</CODE>.  A character type may alias any other
type.
<P>

<A NAME="Type-punning"></A>
Pay special attention to code like this:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>union a_union {
  int i;
  double d;
};

int f() {
  union a_union t;
  t.d = 3.0;
  return t.i;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.  Even with
<SAMP>`-fstrict-aliasing'</SAMP>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC43">4.9 Structures, unions, enumerations, and bit-fields</A>.  However, this code might not:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int f() {
  union a_union t;
  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &#38;t.i;
  return *ip;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int f() {
  double d = 3.0;
  return ((union a_union *) &#38;d)-&#62;i;
}

</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fstrict-overflow</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX793"></A>
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler will assume
that an expression like <CODE>i + 10 &#62; i</CODE> will always be true for
signed <CODE>i</CODE>.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if <CODE>i + 10</CODE> overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers will
overflow must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.
<P>

This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that <CODE>p + u &#62;
p</CODE> is always true for a pointer <CODE>p</CODE> and unsigned integer
<CODE>u</CODE>.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if <CODE>p + u</CODE> overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.
</P><P>

See also the <SAMP>`-fwrapv'</SAMP> option.  Using <SAMP>`-fwrapv'</SAMP> means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
<SAMP>`-fwrapv'</SAMP> is used, there is no difference between
<SAMP>`-fstrict-overflow'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fno-strict-overflow'</SAMP> for
integers.  With <SAMP>`-fwrapv'</SAMP> certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
<SAMP>`-fwrapv'</SAMP>, but not otherwise.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-fstrict-overflow'</SAMP> option is enabled at levels
<SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-fweb</CODE>

Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a

<DT><CODE>-fwhole-program</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX801"></A>
Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of <CODE>main</CODE>
and those merged by attribute <CODE>externally_visible</CODE> become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers. If <CODE>gold</CODE> is used as the linker plugin, <CODE>externally_visible</CODE> attributes are automatically added to functions (not variable yet due to a current <CODE>gold</CODE> issue) that are accessed outside of LTO objects according to resolution file produced by <CODE>gold</CODE>.  For other linkers that cannot generate resolution file, explicit <CODE>externally_visible</CODE> attributes are still necessary.
While this option is equivalent to proper use of the <CODE>static</CODE> keyword for
programs consisting of a single file, in combination with option
<SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> this flag can be used to
compile many smaller scale programs since the functions and variables become
local for the whole combined compilation unit, not for the single source file
itself.
<P>

This option implies <SAMP>`-fwhole-file'</SAMP> for Fortran programs.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-flto[=<VAR>n</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX802"></A>
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
<P>

To use the link-time optimizer, <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> needs to be specified at
compile time and during the final link.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <TT>`foo.o'</TT> and
<TT>`bar.o'</TT>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
<TT>`foo.o'</TT> and <TT>`bar.o'</TT>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<TT>`foo.o'</TT> and <TT>`bar.o'</TT> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<TT>`bar.o'</TT> into functions in <TT>`foo.o'</TT> and vice-versa.
</P><P>

Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The above generates bytecode for <TT>`foo.c'</TT> and <TT>`bar.c'</TT>,
merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <TT>`myprog'</TT>.
</P><P>

The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations the <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> flag needs to be passed to both the
compile and the link commands.
</P><P>

To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <SAMP>`-fuse-linker-plugin'</SAMP>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <SAMP>`-fwhole-program'</SAMP> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
</P><P>

Note that when a file is compiled with <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP>, the generated
object file is larger than a regular object file because it 
contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual final code.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
files; if <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> is not passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.
</P><P>

Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -c -O0 -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O0 -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary <TT>`myprog'</TT> is optimized at
<SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>.  If, instead, the final binary is generated without
<SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP>, then <TT>`myprog'</TT> is not optimized.
</P><P>

When producing the final binary with <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP>, GCC only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.
</P><P>

There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Currently, the following options are saved into the GIMPLE
bytecode files: <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-fcommon'</SAMP> and all the
<SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> target flags.
</P><P>

At link time, these options are read in and reapplied.  Note that the
current implementation makes no attempt to recognize conflicting
values for these options.  If different files have conflicting option
values (e.g., one file is compiled with <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP> and another
isn't), the compiler simply uses the last value read from the
bytecode files.  It is recommended, then, that you compile all the files
participating in the same link with the same options.
</P><P>

If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.
</P><P>

Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages.  This requires
support in the language front end.  Currently, the C, C++ and
Fortran front ends are capable of emitting GIMPLE bytecodes, so
something like this should work:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -c -flto foo.c
g++ -c -flto bar.cc
gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Notice that the final link is done with <CODE>g++</CODE> to get the C++
runtime libraries and <SAMP>`-lgfortran'</SAMP> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation; all you need to add is <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> to
all the compile and link commands.
</P><P>

If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<TT>`libfoo.a'</TT>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To enable this feature, use
the flag <SAMP>`-fuse-linker-plugin'</SAMP> at link time:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
GIMPLE files from <TT>`libfoo.a'</TT> and passes them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.
</P><P>

If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <TT>`libfoo.a'</TT>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the LTO optimization process.
</P><P>

Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fwhole-program'</SAMP> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of <SAMP>`-fwhole-program'</SAMP> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <SAMP>`-fuse-linker-plugin'</SAMP>).
</P><P>

The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC will not work with an older/newer version of GCC.
</P><P>

Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> with
<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> is currently experimental and expected to produce wrong
results.
</P><P>

If you specify the optional <VAR>n</VAR>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <VAR>n</VAR>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <CODE>make</CODE> program.  The
environment variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for <VAR>n</VAR> is 1.
</P><P>

You can also specify <SAMP>`-flto=jobserver'</SAMP> to use GNU make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if <CODE>MAKE</CODE> is
GNU make.

outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not

<DD>Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This

<P>

This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to <CODE>-fwhole-program</CODE>.
See <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> for a description of the effect of this flag and how to

<P>

<SAMP>`-fno-fat-lto-objects'</SAMP> improves compilation time over plain LTO, but

<SAMP>`-fexcess-precision=fast'</SAMP> is in effect; this means that
operations are carried out in the precision of the registers and that
it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
code takes place.  When compiling C, if
<SAMP>`-fexcess-precision=standard'</SAMP> is specified then excess
precision will follow the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <SAMP>`-ffloat-store'</SAMP> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as <SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP> is used.

<A NAME="IDX814"></A>
<SAMP>`-fexcess-precision=standard'</SAMP> is not implemented for languages
other than C, and has no effect if

specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect if <SAMP>`-mfpmath=sse'</SAMP>

for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.
<P>

This option is not turned on by any <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option since

<DD><A NAME="IDX817"></A>
<P>

Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume

<DT><CODE>-fassociative-math</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX818"></A>
<P>

Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
<CODE>(x + 2**52) - 2**52</CODE>.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both <SAMP>`-fno-signed-zeros'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-fno-trapping-math'</SAMP> be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with <SAMP>`-frounding-math'</SAMP>. For Fortran the option

Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example <CODE>x / y</CODE>
can be replaced with <CODE>x * (1/y)</CODE>, which is useful if <CODE>(1/y)</CODE>
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

<DT><CODE>-fno-signed-zeros</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX821"></A>
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with <SAMP>`-ffinite-math-only'</SAMP>).

<DT><CODE>-fno-trapping-math</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX822"></A>
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires

Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating-point
rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.
<P>

The default is <SAMP>`-fno-rounding-math'</SAMP>.

This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all GCC optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of this setting

<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcx-limited-range</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX826"></A>
When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no checking

section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fbranch-probabilities</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX828"></A>
After running a program compiled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC17">Options for Debugging Your Program or <CODE>gcc</CODE></A>), you can compile it a second time using
<SAMP>`-fbranch-probabilities'</SAMP>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <TT>`<VAR>sourcename</VAR>.gcda'</TT> for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.
<P>

With <SAMP>`-fbranch-probabilities'</SAMP>, GCC puts a
<SAMP>`REG_BR_PROB'</SAMP> note on each <SAMP>`JUMP_INSN'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`CALL_INSN'</SAMP>.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <TT>`reorg.c'</TT>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is most likely to take, the <SAMP>`REG_BR_PROB'</SAMP> values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fprofile-values</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX829"></A>
If combined with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.
<P>

With <SAMP>`-fbranch-probabilities'</SAMP>, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions for usage in optimizations.
</P><P>

Enabled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-generate'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fvpt</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX830"></A>
If combined with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>, it instructs the compiler to add
a code to gather information about values of expressions.
<P>

With <SAMP>`-fbranch-probabilities'</SAMP>, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operation
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-frename-registers</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX831"></A>
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
will most benefit processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in
a "home register".
<P>

Enabled by default with <SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fpeel-loops'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ftracer</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX832"></A>
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.
<P>

Enabled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-funroll-loops</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX833"></A>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  <SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP> implies
<SAMP>`-frerun-cse-after-loop'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-fweb'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-frename-registers'</SAMP>.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.
<P>

Enabled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-funroll-all-loops</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX834"></A>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
<SAMP>`-funroll-all-loops'</SAMP> implies the same options as
<SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpeel-loops</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX835"></A>
Peels loops for which there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).
<P>

Enabled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fmove-loop-invariants</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX836"></A>
Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop optimizer.  Enabled
at level <SAMP>`-O1'</SAMP>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-funswitch-loops</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX837"></A>
Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates
of the loop on both branches (modified according to result of the condition).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ffunction-sections</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fdata-sections</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX838"></A>
<A NAME="IDX839"></A>
Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.
<P>

Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.
</P><P>

Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower.
You will not be able to use <CODE>gprof</CODE> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fbranch-target-load-optimize</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX840"></A>
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX841"></A>
Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fbtr-bb-exclusive</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX842"></A>
When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers in within any basic block.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstack-protector</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX843"></A>
Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstack-protector-all</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX844"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-fstack-protector'</SAMP> except that all functions are protected.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fsection-anchors</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX845"></A>
Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared "anchor" symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some
targets.
<P>

For example, the implementation of the following function <CODE>foo</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static int a, b, c;
int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <SAMP>`-fsection-anchors'</SAMP>, it will access the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int foo (void)
{
  register int *xr = &#38;x;
  return xr[&#38;a - &#38;x] + xr[&#38;b - &#38;x] + xr[&#38;c - &#38;x];
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Not all targets support this option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>--param <VAR>name</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX846"></A>
In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, GCC will not inline functions
that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command line using the
<SAMP>`--param'</SAMP> option.
<P>

The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.
</P><P>

In each case, the <VAR>value</VAR> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<VAR>name</VAR> are given in the following table:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>predictable-branch-outcome</CODE>
<DD>When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold
(in percent), then it is considered well predictable. The default is 10.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-crossjump-edges</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by <SAMP>`-fcrossjumping'</SAMP> is <EM>O(N^2)</EM> in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
<P>

<DT><CODE>min-crossjump-insns</CODE>
<DD>The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</CODE>
<DD>The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-goto-duplication-insns</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid <EM>O(N^2)</EM> behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-delay-slot-insn-search</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-delay-slot-live-search</CODE>
<DD>When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-gcse-memory</CODE>
<DD>The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</CODE>
<DD>If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value
for any expression, then RTL PRE will insert or remove the expression and thus
leave partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.  The default value is 20.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-pending-list-length</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make
when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase
compilation time.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-inline-insns-single</CODE>
<DD>Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++).
The default value is 400.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-inline-insns-auto</CODE>
<DD>When you use <SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP> (included in <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 40.
<P>

<DT><CODE>large-function-insns</CODE>
<DD>The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
<SAMP>`--param large-function-growth'</SAMP>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end.
The default value is 2700.
<P>

<DT><CODE>large-function-growth</CODE>
<DD>Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
<P>

<DT><CODE>large-unit-insns</CODE>
<DD>The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <SAMP>`--param inline-unit-growth'</SAMP>.
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <SAMP>`--param large-unit-insns'</SAMP>
before applying <SAMP>`--param inline-unit-growth'</SAMP>.  The default is 10000
<P>

<DT><CODE>inline-unit-growth</CODE>
<DD>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
The default value is 30 which limits unit growth to 1.3 times the original
size.
<P>

<DT><CODE>ipcp-unit-growth</CODE>
<DD>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  The default value is 10 which limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.
<P>

<DT><CODE>large-stack-frame</CODE>
<DD>The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  Default value is 256 bytes.
<P>

<DT><CODE>large-stack-frame-growth</CODE>
<DD>Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-inline-insns-recursive</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</CODE>
<DD>Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.
<P>

For functions declared inline <SAMP>`--param max-inline-insns-recursive'</SAMP> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP> (included in <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>) is
enabled and <SAMP>`--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto'</SAMP> is used.  The
default value is 450.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>max-inline-recursive-depth</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</CODE>
<DD>Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive inlining.
<P>

For functions declared inline <SAMP>`--param max-inline-recursive-depth'</SAMP> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP> (included in <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>) is
enabled and <SAMP>`--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto'</SAMP> is used.  The
default value is 8.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>min-inline-recursive-probability</CODE>
<DD>Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.
<P>

When profile feedback is available (see <SAMP>`-fprofile-generate'</SAMP>) the actual

10.

<P>

<DT><CODE>max-early-inliner-iterations</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>max-early-inliner-iterations</CODE>
<DD>Limit of iterations of early inliner.  This basically bounds number of nested
indirect calls early inliner can resolve.  Deeper chains are still handled by

<P>

<DT><CODE>min-vect-loop-bound</CODE>
<DD>The minimum number of iterations under which a loop will not get vectorized

<P>

<DT><CODE>gcse-cost-distance-ratio</CODE>
<DD>Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by GCSE optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
will be with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than <SAMP>`gcse-unrestricted-cost'</SAMP>.  Specifying 0 will disable
hoisting of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.
<P>

<DT><CODE>gcse-unrestricted-cost</CODE>
<DD>Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which GCSE optimizations will not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,

allow all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.
The default value is 3.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-hoist-depth</CODE>
<DD>The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm.
The value of 0 will avoid limiting the search, but may slow down compilation
of huge functions.  The default value is 30.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-tail-merge-comparisons</CODE>
<DD>The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with.  This is used to
avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail merging.  The default value is 10.

<DD>Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates are considered
if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.
<P>

<DD>The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.
<P>

<DT><CODE>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</CODE>

given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.
<P>

<DT><CODE>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</CODE>
<DD>Select fraction of the entry block frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-predicted-iterations</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where function contain single loop with known bound and other loop
with unknown.  We predict the known number of iterations correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds would appear artificially cold relative to the other one.
<P>

<DT><CODE>align-threshold</CODE>
<DD><P>

Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block will get aligned.
</P><P>

aligned.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>tracer-dynamic-coverage</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</CODE>
<DD><P>

This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback'</SAMP> is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>tracer-max-code-growth</CODE>
<DD>Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.
<P>

<DT><CODE>tracer-min-branch-ratio</CODE>
<DD><P>

Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>tracer-min-branch-ratio</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback</CODE>
<DD><P>

Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.
</P><P>

Similarly to <SAMP>`tracer-dynamic-coverage'</SAMP> two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>max-cse-path-length</CODE>
<DD><P>

Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.  The default is 10.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>max-cse-insns</CODE>
<DD>The maximum instructions CSE process before flushing. The default is 1000.
<P>

<DT><CODE>ggc-min-expand</CODE>
<DD><P>

GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.
</P><P>

The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM &#62;= 1GB.  If <CODE>getrlimit</CODE> is available, the notion of "RAM" is
the smallest of actual RAM and <CODE>RLIMIT_DATA</CODE> or <CODE>RLIMIT_AS</CODE>.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<SAMP>`ggc-min-heapsize'</SAMP> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>ggc-min-heapsize</CODE>
<DD><P>

Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <SAMP>`ggc-min-expand'</SAMP>% beyond <SAMP>`ggc-min-heapsize'</SAMP>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.
</P><P>

The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that
tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <SAMP>`ggc-min-expand'</SAMP> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>max-reload-search-insns</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compilation time increase with probably slightly better performance.
The default value is 100.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-cselib-memory-locations</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account.
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.
<P>

<DT><CODE>reorder-blocks-duplicate</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback</CODE>
<DD><P>

Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional
branch or duplicate the code on its destination.  Code is duplicated when its
estimated size is smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`reorder-block-duplicate-feedback'</SAMP> is used only when profile
feedback is available and may be set to higher values than
<SAMP>`reorder-block-duplicate'</SAMP> since information about the hot spots is more
accurate.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>max-sched-ready-insns</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.  The default value is 100.

interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.

depth of search for available instructions.
The default value is 50.
<P>

<DT><CODE>selsched-max-sched-times</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of times that an instruction will be scheduled during
selective scheduling.  This is the limit on the number of iterations
through which the instruction may be pipelined.  The default value is 2.

<DD>The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list that are considered
for renaming in the selective scheduler.  The default value is 2.

in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.  The default
is 10000.
<P>

<DD>Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant.  The default value is 256.
<P>

<DT><CODE>min-virtual-mappings</CODE>
<DD>Specifies the minimum number of virtual mappings in the incremental
SSA updater that should be registered to trigger the virtual mappings
heuristic defined by virtual-mappings-ratio.  The default value is
100.
<P>

<DT><CODE>virtual-mappings-ratio</CODE>
<DD>If the number of virtual mappings is virtual-mappings-ratio bigger
than the number of virtual symbols to be updated, then the incremental
SSA updater switches to a full update for those symbols.  The default
ratio is 3.
<P>

<DT><CODE>ssp-buffer-size</CODE>
<DD>The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive stack smashing
protection when <SAMP>`-fstack-protection'</SAMP> is used.

duplicated when threading jumps.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</CODE>
<DD>Maximum number of fields in a structure we will treat in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.  The default is zero
for -O0, and -O1 and 100 for -Os, -O2, and -O3.
<P>

<DT><CODE>prefetch-latency</CODE>
<DD>Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before
prefetch finishes.  The distance we prefetch ahead is proportional
to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead to less
streams being prefetched (see <SAMP>`simultaneous-prefetches'</SAMP>).
<P>

<DT><CODE>simultaneous-prefetches</CODE>
<DD>Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.

<DD>The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.
<P>

<DT><CODE>use-canonical-types</CODE>

default, this should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.
<P>

<DT><CODE>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</CODE>
<DD>Switch initialization conversion will refuse to create arrays that are
bigger than <SAMP>`switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio'</SAMP> times the number of
branches in the switch.

<DD>Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (<SAMP>`-ftree-pre'</SAMP>) when
optimizing at <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP> and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter will allow an unlimited set length.
<P>

<DT><CODE>sccvn-max-scc-size</CODE>
<DD>Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during SCCVN
processing.  If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for the whole

the given number of the most frequently-executed loops form regions
for regional register allocation.  The default value of the
parameter is 100.
<P>

<DT><CODE>ira-max-conflict-table-size</CODE>
<DD>Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict
table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for
huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be more
than the size in MB given by this parameter, the register allocator
instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality
algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.  
The default value of the parameter is 2000.
<P>

<DT><CODE>ira-loop-reserved-regs</CODE>
<DD>IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants (see <SAMP>`-O3'</SAMP>).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is given
by this parameter.  The default value of the parameter is 2, which is
the minimal number of registers needed by typical instructions.
This value is the best found from numerous experiments.
<P>

<DT><CODE>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop</CODE>
<DD>Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and
in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.  The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for -O1 and 10000 for -O2 and above.
<P>

<DT><CODE>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps</CODE>
<DD>Building data dapendencies is expensive for very large loops.  This
parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are
considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops will not
be handled then by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.
The default value is 1000.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-vartrack-size</CODE>
<DD>Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.
<P>

<DT><CODE>max-vartrack-expr-depth</CODE>
<DD>Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in
debug information may end up not being used; setting this higher may
enable the compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
time and memory use may grow.  The default is 12.
<P>

<DT><CODE>min-nondebug-insn-uid</CODE>
<DD>Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by
<SAMP>`-fvar-tracking-assignments'</SAMP>, but debug insns may get

<P>

<DT><CODE>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</CODE>
<DD>IPA-SRA will replace a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new

<DT><CODE>tm-max-aggregate-size</CODE>
<DD>When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables will be
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
<SAMP>`-fgnu-tm'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</CODE>
<DD>To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  The
default value is 10 parameters.  A variable whose value is unknown at
compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.
<P>

<DT><CODE>graphite-max-bbs-per-function</CODE>
<DD>To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the size of
the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The default value is

name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is 1000.
<P>

<DT><CODE>sink-frequency-threshold</CODE>
<DD>The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the target block
relative to a statement's original block to allow statement sinking of a
statement.  Larger numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking.

<P>

<DT><CODE>max-stores-to-sink</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of conditional stores paires that can be sunk.  Set to 0
if either vectorization (<SAMP>`-ftree-vectorize'</SAMP>) or if-conversion

<P>

<DT><CODE>allow-packed-store-data-races</CODE>

<H2> 3.11 Options Controlling the Preprocessor </H2>
<!--docid::SEC19::-->
<P>

These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
</P><P>

If you use the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-Wp,<VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX847"></A>
You can use <SAMP>`-Wp,<VAR>option</VAR>'</SAMP> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <VAR>option</VAR> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<VAR>option</VAR> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<SAMP>`-Wp'</SAMP> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using <SAMP>`-Wp'</SAMP> and let the driver handle the
options instead.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Xpreprocessor <VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX848"></A>
Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC does not know how to
recognize.
<P>

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<SAMP>`-Xpreprocessor'</SAMP> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX849"></A>
Predefine <VAR>name</VAR> as a macro, with definition <CODE>1</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>name</VAR>=<VAR>definition</VAR></CODE>
<DD>The contents of <VAR>definition</VAR> are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP>
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.
<P>

If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
</P><P>

If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With <CODE>sh</CODE> and <CODE>csh</CODE>,
<SAMP>`-D'<VAR>name</VAR>(<VAR>args<small>...</small></VAR>)=<VAR>definition</VAR>''</SAMP> works.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All <SAMP>`-imacros <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-include <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> options are processed after all
<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-U <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX850"></A>
Cancel any previous definition of <VAR>name</VAR>, either built in or
provided with a <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-undef</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX851"></A>
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-I <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX852"></A>
Add the directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory <VAR>dir</VAR> is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
.
If <VAR>dir</VAR> begins with <CODE>=</CODE>, then the <CODE>=</CODE> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-isysroot'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX853"></A>
Write output to <VAR>file</VAR>.  This is the same as specifying <VAR>file</VAR>
as the second non-option argument to <CODE>cpp</CODE>.  <CODE>gcc</CODE> has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> to specify the output file.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wall</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX854"></A>
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is <SAMP>`-Wcomment'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Wtrigraphs'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-Wmultichar'</SAMP> and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in <CODE>#if</CODE> expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wcomment</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-Wcomments</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX855"></A>
<A NAME="IDX856"></A>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> appears in a <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP>
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a <SAMP>`//'</SAMP> comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wtrigraphs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX857"></A>
<A NAME="Wtrigraphs"></A>
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (<SAMP>`??/'</SAMP> at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.
<P>

This option is implied by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.  If <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> warnings, use <SAMP>`-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wtraditional</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX858"></A>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wundef</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX859"></A>
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
<SAMP>`#if'</SAMP> directive, outside of <SAMP>`defined'</SAMP>.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused-macros</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX860"></A>
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is <EM>used</EM> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
<P>

Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
</P><P>

<EM>Note:</EM> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
#endif
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wendif-labels</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX861"></A>
Warn whenever an <SAMP>`#else'</SAMP> or an <SAMP>`#endif'</SAMP> are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#if FOO
<small>...</small>
#else FOO
<small>...</small>
#endif FOO
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The second and third <CODE>FOO</CODE> should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Werror</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX862"></A>
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wsystem-headers</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX863"></A>
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX864"></A>
Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-pedantic</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX865"></A>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-pedantic-errors</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX866"></A>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues
without <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> but treats as warnings.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-M</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX867"></A>
<A NAME="IDX868"></A>
<A NAME="IDX869"></A>
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <CODE>make</CODE> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <CODE>make</CODE> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-imacros'</SAMP> command line options.
<P>

Unless specified explicitly (with <SAMP>`-MT'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-MQ'</SAMP>), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>-newline.  The rule has no
commands.
</P><P>

This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
<SAMP>`-dM'</SAMP>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<SAMP>`-MF'</SAMP>, or use an environment variable like
<CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC32">3.19 Environment Variables Affecting GCC</A>).  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
</P><P>

Passing <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> to the driver implies <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <SAMP>`-w'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MM</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX870"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
<P>

This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in <SAMP>`-MM'</SAMP> dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.
</P><P>

<A NAME="dashMF"></A>
<DT><CODE>-MF <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX871"></A>
When used with <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-MM'</SAMP>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no <SAMP>`-MF'</SAMP> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
<P>

When used with the driver options <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-MMD'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-MF'</SAMP> overrides the default dependency output file.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MG</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX872"></A>
In conjunction with an option such as <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> requesting
dependency generation, <SAMP>`-MG'</SAMP> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<CODE>#include</CODE> directive without prepending any path.  <SAMP>`-MG'</SAMP>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
<P>

This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MP</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX873"></A>
This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <CODE>make</CODE> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <TT>`Makefile'</TT> to match.
<P>

This is typical output:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>test.o: test.c test.h

test.h:
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MT <VAR>target</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX874"></A>
<P>

Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
</P><P>

An <SAMP>`-MT'</SAMP> option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <SAMP>`-MT'</SAMP>, or use multiple <SAMP>`-MT'</SAMP> options.
</P><P>

For example, <SAMP>`-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o''</SAMP> might give
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MQ <VAR>target</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX875"></A>
<P>

Same as <SAMP>`-MT'</SAMP>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  <SAMP>`-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o''</SAMP> gives
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<SAMP>`-MQ'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MD</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX876"></A>
<SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`-M -MF <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>, except that
<SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> is not implied.  The driver determines <VAR>file</VAR> based on
whether an <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <TT>`.d'</TT>, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a <TT>`.d'</TT> suffix.
<P>

If <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> is used in conjunction with <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>, any
<SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#dashMF">-MF</A>), but if used without <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>, each <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>
is understood to specify a target object file.
</P><P>

Since <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> is not implied, <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MMD</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX877"></A>
Like <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpch-deps</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX878"></A>
When using precompiled headers (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC33">3.20 Using Precompiled Headers</A>), this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpch-preprocess</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX879"></A>
This option allows use of a precompiled header (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC33">3.20 Using Precompiled Headers</A>) together with <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>.  It inserts a special <CODE>#pragma</CODE>,
<CODE>#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "<VAR>filename</VAR>"</CODE> in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its <VAR>filename</VAR>.
When <SAMP>`-fpreprocessed'</SAMP> is in use, GCC recognizes this <CODE>#pragma</CODE>
and loads the PCH.
<P>

This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on by
<SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

You should not write this <CODE>#pragma</CODE> in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to GCC's
current directory.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-x c</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-x c++</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-x objective-c</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-x assembler-with-cpp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX880"></A>
Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
<SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.cc'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.m'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`.S'</SAMP>.  Some other common
extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.
<P>

<EM>Note:</EM> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <SAMP>`-lang'</SAMP> option
which selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>
option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-std=<VAR>standard</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-ansi</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX881"></A>
<A NAME="IDX882"></A>
Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently CPP

<P>

<DT><CODE>-I-</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX883"></A>
Split the include path.  Any directories specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>
options before <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> are searched only for headers requested with
<CODE>#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"</CODE>; they are not searched for
<CODE>#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;</CODE>.  If additional directories are
specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options after the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>, those
directories are searched for all <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directives.
<P>

In addition, <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> inhibits the use of the directory of the current

"<VAR>file</VAR>"</CODE>.
This option has been deprecated.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdinc</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX884"></A>
Do not search the standard system directories for header files.

(and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdinc++</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX885"></A>
Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option is
used when building the C++ library.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-include <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX886"></A>
Process <VAR>file</VAR> as if <CODE>#include "file"</CODE> appeared as the first
line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for <VAR>file</VAR> is the preprocessor's working directory <EM>instead of</EM>
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the <CODE>#include "<small>...</small>"</CODE> search
chain as normal.
<P>

If multiple <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-imacros <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX887"></A>
Exactly like <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP>, except that any output produced by

This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-idirafter <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX888"></A>
Search <VAR>dir</VAR> for header files, but do it <EM>after</EM> all

This option is like the <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> option, but applies only to
header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both header
files and libraries).  See the <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> option for more
information.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-imultilib <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX893"></A>
Use <VAR>dir</VAR> as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-isystem <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX894"></A>
Search <VAR>dir</VAR> for header files, after all directories specified by
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> but before the standard system directories.  Mark it
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as
is applied to the standard system directories.
If <VAR>dir</VAR> begins with <CODE>=</CODE>, then the <CODE>=</CODE> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-isysroot'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-iquote <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX895"></A>
Search <VAR>dir</VAR> only for header files requested with
<CODE>#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"</CODE>; they are not searched for
<CODE>#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;</CODE>, before all directories specified by
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> and before the standard system directories.
If <VAR>dir</VAR> begins with <CODE>=</CODE>, then the <CODE>=</CODE> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-isysroot'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdirectives-only</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX896"></A>
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.
<P>

The option's behavior depends on the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fpreprocessed'</SAMP>
options.
</P><P>

With <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as <CODE>#define</CODE>, <CODE>#ifdef</CODE>, and <CODE>#error</CODE>.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the <SAMP>`-dD'</SAMP> option is
implicitly enabled.
</P><P>

With <SAMP>`-fpreprocessed'</SAMP>, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as <CODE>__LINE__</CODE>, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with <CODE>-E -fdirectives-only</CODE>.
</P><P>

With both <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fpreprocessed'</SAMP>, the rules for
<SAMP>`-fpreprocessed'</SAMP> take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with <CODE>-E -fdirectives-only</CODE>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fdollars-in-identifiers</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX897"></A>
<A NAME="fdollars-in-identifiers"></A>
Accept <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifiers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fextended-identifiers</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX898"></A>
Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by
default for C99 and C++.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpreprocessed</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX899"></A>
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
<P>

<SAMP>`-fpreprocessed'</SAMP> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.ii'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`.mi'</SAMP>.  These are the
extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by
<SAMP>`-save-temps'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ftabstop=<VAR>width</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX900"></A>
Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdebug-cpp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX901"></A>
This option is only useful for debugging GCC.  When used with
<SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>, dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every
token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location
belongs to.  The dump of the map holding the location of a token would
be:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{<SAMP>`P'</SAMP>:<TT>`/file/path'</TT>;<SAMP>`F'</SAMP>:<TT>`/includer/path'</TT>;<SAMP>`L'</SAMP>:<VAR>line_num</VAR>;<SAMP>`C'</SAMP>:<VAR>col_num</VAR>;<SAMP>`S'</SAMP>:<VAR>system_header_p</VAR>;<SAMP>`M'</SAMP>:<VAR>map_address</VAR>;<SAMP>`E'</SAMP>:<VAR>macro_expansion_p</VAR>,<SAMP>`loc'</SAMP>:<VAR>location</VAR>}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table><P>

When used without <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>, this option has no effect.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ftrack-macro-expansion[=<VAR>level</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX902"></A>
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The <VAR>level</VAR> parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> of <VAR>level</VAR> de-activates
this option just as if no <SAMP>`-ftrack-macro-expansion'</SAMP> was present
on the command line. Value <SAMP>`1'</SAMP> tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value <SAMP>`2'</SAMP> tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
<SAMP>`2'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fexec-charset=<VAR>charset</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX903"></A>
<A NAME="IDX904"></A>
Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is UTF-8.  <VAR>charset</VAR> can be any encoding
supported by the system's <CODE>iconv</CODE> library routine.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fwide-exec-charset=<VAR>charset</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX905"></A>
<A NAME="IDX906"></A>
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever
corresponds to the width of <CODE>wchar_t</CODE>.  As with
<SAMP>`-fexec-charset'</SAMP>, <VAR>charset</VAR> can be any encoding supported
by the system's <CODE>iconv</CODE> library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in <CODE>wchar_t</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-finput-charset=<VAR>charset</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX907"></A>
<A NAME="IDX908"></A>
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by GCC.  If the
locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  <VAR>charset</VAR> can be any encoding
supported by the system's <CODE>iconv</CODE> library routine.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fworking-directory</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX909"></A>
<A NAME="IDX910"></A>
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form <SAMP>`-fno-working-directory'</SAMP>.  If the <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
<CODE>#line</CODE> directives are emitted whatsoever.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-show-column</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX911"></A>
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if
diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the
column numbers, such as <CODE>dejagnu</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-A <VAR>predicate</VAR>=<VAR>answer</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX912"></A>
Make an assertion with the predicate <VAR>predicate</VAR> and answer
<VAR>answer</VAR>.  This form is preferred to the older form <SAMP>`-A
<VAR>predicate</VAR>(<VAR>answer</VAR>)'</SAMP>, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-A -<VAR>predicate</VAR>=<VAR>answer</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Cancel an assertion with the predicate <VAR>predicate</VAR> and answer
<VAR>answer</VAR>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-dCHARS</CODE>
<DD><VAR>CHARS</VAR> is a sequence of one or more of the following characters,
and must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted
by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so
are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior
conflicts, the result is undefined.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`M'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX913"></A>
Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP>
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file <TT>`foo.h'</TT>, the command
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will show all the predefined macros.
</P><P>

If you use <SAMP>`-dM'</SAMP> without the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option, <SAMP>`-dM'</SAMP> is
interpreted as a synonym for <SAMP>`-fdump-rtl-mach'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC17">3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC</A>.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`D'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX914"></A>
Like <SAMP>`M'</SAMP> except in two respects: it does <EM>not</EM> include the
predefined macros, and it outputs <EM>both</EM> the <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP>
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`N'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX915"></A>
Like <SAMP>`D'</SAMP>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`I'</SAMP>

Output <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`U'</SAMP>
<DD><A NAME="IDX917"></A>
Like <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the
output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
<SAMP>`#undef'</SAMP> directives are also output for macros tested but
undefined at the time.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX918"></A>
Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.
This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-C</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX919"></A>
Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
<P>

You should be prepared for side effects when using <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP>; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-CC</CODE>
<DD>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP>, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
<P>

In addition to the side-effects of the <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP> option, the
<SAMP>`-CC'</SAMP> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-CC'</SAMP> option is generally used to support lint comments.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-traditional-cpp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX920"></A>
Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as
opposed to ISO C preprocessors.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-trigraphs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX921"></A>
Process trigraph sequences.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with <SAMP>`??'</SAMP>, that
are defined by ISO C to stand for single characters.  For example,
<SAMP>`??/'</SAMP> stands for <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, so <SAMP>`'??/n''</SAMP> is a character
constant for a newline.  By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> options.

<H2> 3.13 Options for Linking </H2>
<!--docid::SEC21::-->
<P>

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX930"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>object-file-name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-S</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX931"></A>
<A NAME="IDX932"></A>
<A NAME="IDX933"></A>
If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC10">3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</A>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX934"></A>
<DT><CODE>-l<VAR>library</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-l <VAR>library</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX935"></A>
Search the library named <VAR>library</VAR> when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)
<P>

It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <SAMP>`foo.o -lz bar.o'</SAMP> searches library <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>
after file <TT>`foo.o'</TT> but before <TT>`bar.o'</TT>.  If <TT>`bar.o'</TT> refers
to functions in <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>, those functions may not be loaded.
</P><P>

The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <TT>`lib<VAR>library</VAR>.a'</TT>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
</P><P>

The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option and specifying a file name
is that <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> surrounds <VAR>library</VAR> with <SAMP>`lib'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP>
and searches several directories.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-lobjc</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX936"></A>
You need this special case of the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-nostartfiles</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX937"></A>
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless <SAMP>`-nostdlib'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`-nodefaultlibs'</SAMP> is used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-nodefaultlibs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX938"></A>
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker, options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as <CODE>-static-libgcc</CODE>
or <CODE>-shared-libgcc</CODE>, will be ignored.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <SAMP>`-nostartfiles'</SAMP>
is used.  The compiler may generate calls to <CODE>memcmp</CODE>,
<CODE>memset</CODE>, <CODE>memcpy</CODE> and <CODE>memmove</CODE>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdlib</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX939"></A>
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker, options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
<CODE>-static-libgcc</CODE> or <CODE>-shared-libgcc</CODE>, will be ignored.
The compiler may generate calls to <CODE>memcmp</CODE>, <CODE>memset</CODE>,
<CODE>memcpy</CODE> and <CODE>memmove</CODE>.

One of the standard libraries bypassed by <SAMP>`-nostdlib'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-nodefaultlibs'</SAMP> is <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>, a library of internal subroutines
which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
(See section `Interfacing to GCC Output' in <CITE>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals</CITE>,
for more discussion of <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.)
In most cases, you need <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <SAMP>`-nostdlib'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`-nodefaultlibs'</SAMP> you should usually specify <SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
library subroutines.  (For example, <SAMP>`__main'</SAMP>, used to ensure C++
constructors will be called; see section `<CODE>collect2</CODE>' in <CITE>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals</CITE>.)

<DT><CODE>-pie</CODE>

Produce a position independent executable on targets that support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options

<P>

<DT><CODE>-rdynamic</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX947"></A>
Pass the flag <SAMP>`-export-dynamic'</SAMP> to the ELF linker, on targets

generate code (<SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP>, or model suboptions)
when you specify this option.<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="gcc.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-shared-libgcc</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-static-libgcc</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX951"></A>
<A NAME="IDX952"></A>
On systems that provide <TT>`libgcc'</TT> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version respectively.
If no shared version of <TT>`libgcc'</TT> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
<P>

There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared <TT>`libgcc'</TT> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared <TT>`libgcc'</TT>.
</P><P>

Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
<SAMP>`-shared-libgcc'</SAMP> whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.
</P><P>

If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they will not always be linked with the shared <TT>`libgcc'</TT>.
If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a GNU linker that does not support option <SAMP>`--eh-frame-hdr'</SAMP>,
it will link the shared version of <TT>`libgcc'</TT> into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of <TT>`libgcc'</TT>, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
</P><P>

However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
<SAMP>`-shared-libgcc'</SAMP>, such that it is linked with the shared
<TT>`libgcc'</TT>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-static-libstdc++</CODE>
<DD>When the <CODE>g++</CODE> program is used to link a C++ program, it will
normally automatically link against <SAMP>`libstdc++'</SAMP>.  If
<TT>`libstdc++'</TT> is available as a shared library, and the
<SAMP>`-static'</SAMP> option is not used, then this will link against the
shared version of <TT>`libstdc++'</TT>.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of <TT>`libstdc++'</TT> used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
<SAMP>`-static-libstdc++'</SAMP> option directs the <CODE>g++</CODE> driver to
link <TT>`libstdc++'</TT> statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-symbolic</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX953"></A>
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <SAMP>`-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs'</SAMP>).  Only a few systems support
this option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-T <VAR>script</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX954"></A>
<A NAME="IDX955"></A>
Use <VAR>script</VAR> as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Xlinker <VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX956"></A>
Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not recognize.
<P>

If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
<SAMP>`-Xlinker'</SAMP> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass <SAMP>`-assert definitions'</SAMP>, you must write
<SAMP>`-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'</SAMP>.  It does not work to write
<SAMP>`-Xlinker "-assert definitions"'</SAMP>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
</P><P>

When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the <SAMP>`<VAR>option</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR>'</SAMP>
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
<SAMP>`-Xlinker -Map=output.map'</SAMP> rather than
<SAMP>`-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map'</SAMP>.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wl,<VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX957"></A>
Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the linker.  If <VAR>option</VAR> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, <SAMP>`-Wl,-Map,output.map'</SAMP> passes <SAMP>`-Map output.map'</SAMP> to the
linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
<SAMP>`-Wl,-Map=output.map'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX958"></A>
Pretend the symbol <VAR>symbol</VAR> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

<H2> 3.14 Options for Directory Search </H2>
<!--docid::SEC22::-->
<P>

These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-I<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX959"></A>
Add the directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use <SAMP>`-isystem'</SAMP> for that).  If you use more than
one <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
<P>

If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<SAMP>`-isystem'</SAMP>, is also specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>, the <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <SAMP>`-nostdinc'</SAMP> and/or <SAMP>`-isystem'</SAMP> options.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-iplugindir=<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by <SAMP>`-fplugin=<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> instead of
<SAMP>`-fplugin=<VAR>path</VAR>/<VAR>name</VAR>.so'</SAMP>.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-iquote<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX960"></A>
Add the directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of <SAMP>`#include
"<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>; they are not searched for <SAMP>`#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP>,
otherwise just like <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-L<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX961"></A>
Add directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the list of directories to be searched
for <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-B<VAR>prefix</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX962"></A>
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
<P>

The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<TT>`cpp'</TT>, <TT>`cc1'</TT>, <TT>`as'</TT> and <TT>`ld'</TT>.  It tries
<VAR>prefix</VAR> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without <SAMP>`<VAR>machine</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>/'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC24">3.16 Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version</A>).
</P><P>

For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
<TT>`/usr/lib/gcc/'</TT> and <TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc/'</TT>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable.
</P><P>

The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <SAMP>`-isystem'</SAMP> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends <SAMP>`include'</SAMP> to the prefix.
</P><P>

The runtime support file <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> can also be searched for using
the <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
</P><P>

Another way to specify a prefix much like the <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefix is to use
the environment variable <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC32">3.19 Environment Variables Affecting GCC</A>.
</P><P>

As a special kludge, if the path provided by <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> is
<TT>`[dir/]stage<VAR>N</VAR>/'</TT>, where <VAR>N</VAR> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it will be replaced by <TT>`[dir/]include'</TT>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-specs=<VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX963"></A>
Process <VAR>file</VAR> after the compiler reads in the standard <TT>`specs'</TT>
file, in order to override the defaults which the <TT>`gcc'</TT> driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to <TT>`cc1'</TT>,
<TT>`cc1plus'</TT>, <TT>`as'</TT>, <TT>`ld'</TT>, etc.  More than one
<SAMP>`-specs=<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
<P>

<DT><CODE>--sysroot=<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX964"></A>
Use <VAR>dir</VAR> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler would normally search for headers in
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT> and libraries in <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>, it will instead
search <TT>`<VAR>dir</VAR>/usr/include'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>dir</VAR>/usr/lib'</TT>.
<P>

If you use both this option and the <SAMP>`-isysroot'</SAMP> option, then
the <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> option will apply to libraries, but the
<SAMP>`-isysroot'</SAMP> option will apply to header files.
</P><P>

The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of <SAMP>`--sysroot'</SAMP> will still work, but the
library aspect will not.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-I-</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX965"></A>
This option has been deprecated.  Please use <SAMP>`-iquote'</SAMP> instead for
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> directories before the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> and remove the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>.
Any directories you specify with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options before the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>
option are searched only for the case of <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>;
they are not searched for <SAMP>`#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP>.
<P>

If additional directories are specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options after
the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>, these directories are searched for all <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>
directives.  (Ordinarily <EM>all</EM> <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> directories are used
this way.)
</P><P>

In addition, the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>.  There is no way to
override this effect of <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>.  With <SAMP>`-I.'</SAMP> you can specify
searching the directory that was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-nostdinc'</SAMP> are
independent.

<H2> 3.15 Specifying subprocesses and the switches to pass to them </H2>
<!--docid::SEC23::-->
<P>

<CODE>gcc</CODE> is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a
sequence of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and
linking.  GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to
deduce which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options
it ought to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled
by <EM>spec strings</EM>.  In most cases there is one spec string for each
program that GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec
strings to control their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can
be overridden by using the <SAMP>`-specs='</SAMP> command-line switch to specify
a spec file.
</P><P>

<EM>Spec files</EM> are plaintext files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank
lines.  The type of directive is determined by the first non-whitespace
character on the line, which can be one of the following:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>%<VAR>command</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Issues a <VAR>command</VAR> to the spec file processor.  The commands that can
appear here are:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>%include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX966"></A>
Search for <VAR>file</VAR> and insert its text at the current point in the
specs file.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%include_noerr &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX967"></A>
Just like <SAMP>`%include'</SAMP>, but do not generate an error message if the include
file cannot be found.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%rename <VAR>old_name</VAR> <VAR>new_name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX968"></A>
Rename the spec string <VAR>old_name</VAR> to <VAR>new_name</VAR>.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>*[<VAR>spec_name</VAR>]:</CODE>
<DD>This tells the compiler to create, override or delete the named spec
string.  All lines after this directive up to the next directive or
blank line are considered to be the text for the spec string.  If this
results in an empty string then the spec will be deleted.  (Or, if the
spec did not exist, then nothing will happen.)  Otherwise, if the spec
does not currently exist a new spec will be created.  If the spec does
exist then its contents will be overridden by the text of this
directive, unless the first character of that text is the <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
character, in which case the text will be appended to the spec.
<P>

<DT><CODE>[<VAR>suffix</VAR>]:</CODE>
<DD>Creates a new <SAMP>`[<VAR>suffix</VAR>] spec'</SAMP> pair.  All lines after this directive
and up to the next directive or blank line are considered to make up the
spec string for the indicated suffix.  When the compiler encounters an
input file with the named suffix, it will processes the spec string in
order to work out how to compile that file.  For example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>.ZZ:
z-compile -input %i
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This says that any input file whose name ends in <SAMP>`.ZZ'</SAMP> should be
passed to the program <SAMP>`z-compile'</SAMP>, which should be invoked with the
command-line switch <SAMP>`-input'</SAMP> and with the result of performing the
<SAMP>`%i'</SAMP> substitution.  (See below.)
</P><P>

As an alternative to providing a spec string, the text that follows a
suffix directive can be one of the following:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>@<VAR>language</VAR></CODE>
<DD>This says that the suffix is an alias for a known <VAR>language</VAR>.  This is
similar to using the <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> command-line switch to GCC to specify a
language explicitly.  For example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>.ZZ:
@c++
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Says that .ZZ files are, in fact, C++ source files.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>#<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>This causes an error messages saying:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre><VAR>name</VAR> compiler not installed on this system.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></DL>
<P>

GCC already has an extensive list of suffixes built into it.
This directive will add an entry to the end of the list of suffixes, but
since the list is searched from the end backwards, it is effectively
possible to override earlier entries using this technique.
</P><P>

</DL>
<P>

GCC has the following spec strings built into it.  Spec files can
override these strings or create their own.  Note that individual
targets can also add their own spec strings to this list.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm          Options to pass to the assembler
asm_final    Options to pass to the assembler post-processor
cpp          Options to pass to the C preprocessor
cc1          Options to pass to the C compiler
cc1plus      Options to pass to the C++ compiler
endfile      Object files to include at the end of the link
link         Options to pass to the linker
lib          Libraries to include on the command line to the linker
libgcc       Decides which GCC support library to pass to the linker
linker       Sets the name of the linker
predefines   Defines to be passed to the C preprocessor
signed_char  Defines to pass to CPP to say whether <CODE>char</CODE> is signed
             by default
startfile    Object files to include at the start of the link
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here is a small example of a spec file:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>%rename lib                 old_lib

*lib:
--start-group -lgcc -lc -leval1 --end-group %(old_lib)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This example renames the spec called <SAMP>`lib'</SAMP> to <SAMP>`old_lib'</SAMP> and
then overrides the previous definition of <SAMP>`lib'</SAMP> with a new one.
The new definition adds in some extra command-line options before
including the text of the old definition.
</P><P>

<EM>Spec strings</EM> are a list of command-line options to be passed to their
corresponding program.  In addition, the spec strings can contain
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP>-prefixed sequences to substitute variable text or to
conditionally insert text into the command line.  Using these constructs
it is possible to generate quite complex command lines.
</P><P>

Here is a table of all defined <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>-sequences for spec
strings.  Note that spaces are not generated automatically around the
results of expanding these sequences.  Therefore you can concatenate them
together or combine them with constant text in a single argument.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>%%</CODE>
<DD>Substitute one <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> into the program name or argument.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%i</CODE>
<DD>Substitute the name of the input file being processed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%b</CODE>
<DD>Substitute the basename of the input file being processed.
This is the substring up to (and not including) the last period
and not including the directory.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%B</CODE>
<DD>This is the same as <SAMP>`%b'</SAMP>, but include the file suffix (text after
the last period).
<P>

<DT><CODE>%d</CODE>
<DD>Marks the argument containing or following the <SAMP>`%d'</SAMP> as a
temporary file name, so that that file will be deleted if GCC exits
successfully.  Unlike <SAMP>`%g'</SAMP>, this contributes no text to the
argument.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%g<VAR>suffix</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Substitute a file name that has suffix <VAR>suffix</VAR> and is chosen
once per compilation, and mark the argument in the same way as
<SAMP>`%d'</SAMP>.  To reduce exposure to denial-of-service attacks, the file
name is now chosen in a way that is hard to predict even when previously
chosen file names are known.  For example, <SAMP>`%g.s <small>...</small> %g.o <small>...</small> %g.s'</SAMP>
might turn into <SAMP>`ccUVUUAU.s ccXYAXZ12.o ccUVUUAU.s'</SAMP>.  <VAR>suffix</VAR> matches
the regexp <SAMP>`[.A-Za-z]*'</SAMP> or the special string <SAMP>`%O'</SAMP>, which is
treated exactly as if <SAMP>`%O'</SAMP> had been preprocessed.  Previously, <SAMP>`%g'</SAMP>
was simply substituted with a file name chosen once per compilation,
without regard to any appended suffix (which was therefore treated
just like ordinary text), making such attacks more likely to succeed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%u<VAR>suffix</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`%g'</SAMP>, but generates a new temporary file name even if
<SAMP>`%u<VAR>suffix</VAR>'</SAMP> was already seen.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%U<VAR>suffix</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Substitutes the last file name generated with <SAMP>`%u<VAR>suffix</VAR>'</SAMP>, generating a
new one if there is no such last file name.  In the absence of any
<SAMP>`%u<VAR>suffix</VAR>'</SAMP>, this is just like <SAMP>`%g<VAR>suffix</VAR>'</SAMP>, except they don't share
the same suffix <EM>space</EM>, so <SAMP>`%g.s <small>...</small> %U.s <small>...</small> %g.s <small>...</small> %U.s'</SAMP>
would involve the generation of two distinct file names, one
for each <SAMP>`%g.s'</SAMP> and another for each <SAMP>`%U.s'</SAMP>.  Previously, <SAMP>`%U'</SAMP> was
simply substituted with a file name chosen for the previous <SAMP>`%u'</SAMP>,
without regard to any appended suffix.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%j<VAR>suffix</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Substitutes the name of the <CODE>HOST_BIT_BUCKET</CODE>, if any, and if it is
writable, and if save-temps is off; otherwise, substitute the name
of a temporary file, just like <SAMP>`%u'</SAMP>.  This temporary file is not
meant for communication between processes, but rather as a junk
disposal mechanism.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%|<VAR>suffix</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>%m<VAR>suffix</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`%g'</SAMP>, except if <SAMP>`-pipe'</SAMP> is in effect.  In that case
<SAMP>`%|'</SAMP> substitutes a single dash and <SAMP>`%m'</SAMP> substitutes nothing at
all.  These are the two most common ways to instruct a program that it
should read from standard input or write to standard output.  If you
need something more elaborate you can use an <SAMP>`%{pipe:<CODE>X</CODE>}'</SAMP>
construct: see for example <TT>`f/lang-specs.h'</TT>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%.<VAR>SUFFIX</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <VAR>.SUFFIX</VAR> for the suffixes of a matched switch's args
when it is subsequently output with <SAMP>`%*'</SAMP>.  <VAR>SUFFIX</VAR> is
terminated by the next space or %.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%w</CODE>
<DD>Marks the argument containing or following the <SAMP>`%w'</SAMP> as the
designated output file of this compilation.  This puts the argument
into the sequence of arguments that <SAMP>`%o'</SAMP> will substitute later.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%o</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes the names of all the output files, with spaces
automatically placed around them.  You should write spaces
around the <SAMP>`%o'</SAMP> as well or the results are undefined.
<SAMP>`%o'</SAMP> is for use in the specs for running the linker.
Input files whose names have no recognized suffix are not compiled
at all, but they are included among the output files, so they will
be linked.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%O</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes the suffix for object files.  Note that this is
handled specially when it immediately follows <SAMP>`%g, %u, or %U'</SAMP>,
because of the need for those to form complete file names.  The
handling is such that <SAMP>`%O'</SAMP> is treated exactly as if it had already
been substituted, except that <SAMP>`%g, %u, and %U'</SAMP> do not currently
support additional <VAR>suffix</VAR> characters following <SAMP>`%O'</SAMP> as they would
following, for example, <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%p</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes the standard macro predefinitions for the
current target machine.  Use this when running <CODE>cpp</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%P</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`%p'</SAMP>, but puts <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> before and after the name of each
predefined macro, except for macros that start with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> or with
<SAMP>`_<VAR>L</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>L</VAR> is an uppercase letter.  This is for ISO
C.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%I</CODE>
<DD>Substitute any of <SAMP>`-iprefix'</SAMP> (made from <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>),
<SAMP>`-isysroot'</SAMP> (made from <CODE>TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT</CODE>),
<SAMP>`-isystem'</SAMP> (made from <CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE> and <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> options)
and <SAMP>`-imultilib'</SAMP> as necessary.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%s</CODE>
<DD>Current argument is the name of a library or startup file of some sort.
Search for that file in a standard list of directories and substitute
the full name found.  The current working directory is included in the
list of directories scanned.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%T</CODE>
<DD>Current argument is the name of a linker script.  Search for that file
in the current list of directories to scan for libraries. If the file
is located insert a <SAMP>`--script'</SAMP> option into the command line
followed by the full path name found.  If the file is not found then
generate an error message.  Note: the current working directory is not
searched.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%e<VAR>str</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print <VAR>str</VAR> as an error message.  <VAR>str</VAR> is terminated by a newline.
Use this when inconsistent options are detected.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%(<VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Substitute the contents of spec string <VAR>name</VAR> at this point.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%x{<VAR>option</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>Accumulate an option for <SAMP>`%X'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%X</CODE>
<DD>Output the accumulated linker options specified by <SAMP>`-Wl'</SAMP> or a <SAMP>`%x'</SAMP>
spec string.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%Y</CODE>
<DD>Output the accumulated assembler options specified by <SAMP>`-Wa'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%Z</CODE>
<DD>Output the accumulated preprocessor options specified by <SAMP>`-Wp'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%a</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>asm</CODE> spec.  This is used to compute the
switches to be passed to the assembler.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%A</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>asm_final</CODE> spec.  This is a spec string for
passing switches to an assembler post-processor, if such a program is
needed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%l</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>link</CODE> spec.  This is the spec for computing the
command line passed to the linker.  Typically it will make use of the
<SAMP>`%L %G %S %D and %E'</SAMP> sequences.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%D</CODE>
<DD>Dump out a <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> option for each directory that GCC believes might
contain startup files.  If the target supports multilibs then the
current multilib directory will be prepended to each of these paths.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%L</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>lib</CODE> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding which
libraries should be included on the command line to the linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%G</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>libgcc</CODE> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding
which GCC support library should be included on the command line to the linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%S</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>startfile</CODE> spec.  This is a spec for deciding which
object files should be the first ones passed to the linker.  Typically
this might be a file named <TT>`crt0.o'</TT>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%E</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>endfile</CODE> spec.  This is a spec string that specifies
the last object files that will be passed to the linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%C</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>cpp</CODE> spec.  This is used to construct the arguments
to be passed to the C preprocessor.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%1</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>cc1</CODE> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C compiler (<SAMP>`cc1'</SAMP>).
<P>

<DT><CODE>%2</CODE>
<DD>Process the <CODE>cc1plus</CODE> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C++ compiler (<SAMP>`cc1plus'</SAMP>).
<P>

<DT><CODE>%*</CODE>
<DD>Substitute the variable part of a matched option.  See below.
Note that each comma in the substituted string is replaced by
a single space.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%&#60;<CODE>S</CODE></CODE>
<DD>Remove all occurrences of <CODE>-S</CODE> from the command line.  Note--this
command is position dependent.  <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> commands in the spec string
before this one will see <CODE>-S</CODE>, <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> commands in the spec string
after this one will not.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%:<VAR>function</VAR>(<VAR>args</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Call the named function <VAR>function</VAR>, passing it <VAR>args</VAR>.
<VAR>args</VAR> is first processed as a nested spec string, then split
into an argument vector in the usual fashion.  The function returns
a string which is processed as if it had appeared literally as part
of the current spec.
<P>

The following built-in spec functions are provided:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE><CODE>getenv</CODE></CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>getenv</CODE> spec function takes two arguments: an environment
variable name and a string.  If the environment variable is not
defined, a fatal error is issued.  Otherwise, the return value is the
value of the environment variable concatenated with the string.  For
example, if <CODE>TOPDIR</CODE> is defined as <TT>`/path/to/top'</TT>, then:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>%:getenv(TOPDIR /include)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

expands to <TT>`/path/to/top/include'</TT>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE><CODE>if-exists</CODE></CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>if-exists</CODE> spec function takes one argument, an absolute
pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <CODE>if-exists</CODE> returns the
pathname.  Here is a small example of its usage:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>*startfile:
crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) crtbegin%O%s
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE><CODE>if-exists-else</CODE></CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>if-exists-else</CODE> spec function is similar to the <CODE>if-exists</CODE>
spec function, except that it takes two arguments.  The first argument is
an absolute pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <CODE>if-exists-else</CODE>
returns the pathname.  If it does not exist, it returns the second argument.
This way, <CODE>if-exists-else</CODE> can be used to select one file or another,
based on the existence of the first.  Here is a small example of its usage:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>*startfile:
crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) \
%:if-exists-else(crtbeginT%O%s crtbegin%O%s)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE><CODE>replace-outfile</CODE></CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>replace-outfile</CODE> spec function takes two arguments.  It looks for the
first argument in the outfiles array and replaces it with the second argument.  Here
is a small example of its usage:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>%{fgnu-runtime:%:replace-outfile(-lobjc -lobjc-gnu)}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE><CODE>remove-outfile</CODE></CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>remove-outfile</CODE> spec function takes one argument.  It looks for the
first argument in the outfiles array and removes it.  Here is a small example
its usage:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>%:remove-outfile(-lm)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE><CODE>pass-through-libs</CODE></CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>pass-through-libs</CODE> spec function takes any number of arguments.  It
finds any <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> options and any non-options ending in ".a" (which it
assumes are the names of linker input library archive files) and returns a
result containing all the found arguments each prepended by
<SAMP>`-plugin-opt=-pass-through='</SAMP> and joined by spaces.  This list is
intended to be passed to the LTO linker plugin.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>%:pass-through-libs(%G %L %G)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE><CODE>print-asm-header</CODE></CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>print-asm-header</CODE> function takes no arguments and simply
prints a banner like:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>Assembler options
=================

Use "-Wa,OPTION" to pass "OPTION" to the assembler.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is used to separate compiler options from assembler options
in the <SAMP>`--target-help'</SAMP> output.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{<CODE>S</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes the <CODE>-S</CODE> switch, if that switch was given to GCC.
If that switch was not specified, this substitutes nothing.  Note that
the leading dash is omitted when specifying this option, and it is
automatically inserted if the substitution is performed.  Thus the spec
string <SAMP>`%{foo}'</SAMP> would match the command-line option <SAMP>`-foo'</SAMP>
and would output the command-line option <SAMP>`-foo'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%W{<CODE>S</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Like %{<CODE>S</CODE>} but mark last argument supplied within as a file to be
deleted on failure.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{<CODE>S</CODE>*}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes all the switches specified to GCC whose names start
with <CODE>-S</CODE>, but which also take an argument.  This is used for
switches like <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>, etc.
GCC considers <SAMP>`-o foo'</SAMP> as being
one switch whose names starts with <SAMP>`o'</SAMP>.  %{o*} would substitute this
text, including the space.  Thus two arguments would be generated.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{<CODE>S</CODE>*&#38;<CODE>T</CODE>*}</CODE>
<DD>Like %{<CODE>S</CODE>*}, but preserve order of <CODE>S</CODE> and <CODE>T</CODE> options
(the order of <CODE>S</CODE> and <CODE>T</CODE> in the spec is not significant).
There can be any number of ampersand-separated variables; for each the
wild card is optional.  Useful for CPP as <SAMP>`%{D*&#38;U*&#38;A*}'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{<CODE>S</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE>, if the <SAMP>`-S'</SAMP> switch was given to GCC.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{!<CODE>S</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE>, if the <SAMP>`-S'</SAMP> switch was <EM>not</EM> given to GCC.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{<CODE>S</CODE>*:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE> if one or more switches whose names start with
<CODE>-S</CODE> are specified to GCC.  Normally <CODE>X</CODE> is substituted only
once, no matter how many such switches appeared.  However, if <CODE>%*</CODE>
appears somewhere in <CODE>X</CODE>, then <CODE>X</CODE> will be substituted once
for each matching switch, with the <CODE>%*</CODE> replaced by the part of
that switch that matched the <CODE>*</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{.<CODE>S</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE>, if processing a file with suffix <CODE>S</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{!.<CODE>S</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE>, if <EM>not</EM> processing a file with suffix <CODE>S</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{,<CODE>S</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE>, if processing a file for language <CODE>S</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{!,<CODE>S</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE>, if not processing a file for language <CODE>S</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>%{<CODE>S</CODE>|<CODE>P</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>}</CODE>
<DD>Substitutes <CODE>X</CODE> if either <CODE>-S</CODE> or <CODE>-P</CODE> was given to
GCC.  This may be combined with <SAMP>`!'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`,'</SAMP>, and
<CODE>*</CODE> sequences as well, although they have a stronger binding than
the <SAMP>`|'</SAMP>.  If <CODE>%*</CODE> appears in <CODE>X</CODE>, all of the
alternatives must be starred, and only the first matching alternative
is substituted.
<P>

For example, a spec string like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>%{.c:-foo} %{!.c:-bar} %{.c|d:-baz} %{!.c|d:-boggle}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will output the following command-line options from the following input
command-line options:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>fred.c        -foo -baz
jim.d         -bar -boggle
-d fred.c     -foo -baz -boggle
-d jim.d      -bar -baz -boggle
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>%{S:X; T:Y; :D}</CODE>
<DD><P>

If <CODE>S</CODE> was given to GCC, substitutes <CODE>X</CODE>; else if <CODE>T</CODE> was
given to GCC, substitutes <CODE>Y</CODE>; else substitutes <CODE>D</CODE>.  There can
be as many clauses as you need.  This may be combined with <CODE>.</CODE>,
<CODE>,</CODE>, <CODE>!</CODE>, <CODE>|</CODE>, and <CODE>*</CODE> as needed.
</P><P>

</DL>
<P>

The conditional text <CODE>X</CODE> in a %{<CODE>S</CODE>:<CODE>X</CODE>} or similar
construct may contain other nested <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> constructs or spaces, or
even newlines.  They are processed as usual, as described above.
Trailing white space in <CODE>X</CODE> is ignored.  White space may also
appear anywhere on the left side of the colon in these constructs,
except between <CODE>.</CODE> or <CODE>*</CODE> and the corresponding word.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP> switches are
handled specifically in these constructs.  If another value of
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> or the negated form of a <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>, or
<SAMP>`-W'</SAMP> switch is found later in the command line, the earlier
switch value is ignored, except with {<CODE>S</CODE>*} where <CODE>S</CODE> is
just one letter, which passes all matching options.
</P><P>

The character <SAMP>`|'</SAMP> at the beginning of the predicate text is used to
indicate that a command should be piped to the following command, but
only if <SAMP>`-pipe'</SAMP> is specified.
</P><P>

It is built into GCC which switches take arguments and which do not.
(You might think it would be useful to generalize this to allow each
compiler's spec to say which switches take arguments.  But this cannot
be done in a consistent fashion.  GCC cannot even decide which input
files have been specified without knowing which switches take arguments,
and it must know which input files to compile in order to tell which
compilers to run).
</P><P>

GCC also knows implicitly that arguments starting in <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> are to be
treated as compiler output files, and passed to the linker in their
proper position among the other output files.

<P>

<DT><CODE>-malign-300</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX977"></A>
On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for the H8/300.
The default for the H8/300H and H8S is to align longs and floats on
4-byte boundaries.
<SAMP>`-malign-300'</SAMP> causes them to be aligned on 2-byte boundaries.
This option has no effect on the H8/300.

<DT><CODE>-msim</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX979"></A>
Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes
an alternate runtime library to be linked in which supports, for
example, file I/O.  You must not use this option when generating
programs that will run on real hardware; you must provide your own
runtime library for whatever I/O functions are needed.

<DD><A NAME="IDX980"></A>
Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC will use
during code generation.  These pseudo-registers will be used like real
registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to fit the
code into available registers, and the performance penalty of using
memory instead of registers.  Note that all modules in a program must
be compiled with the same value for this option.  Because of that, you
must not use this option with the default runtime libraries gcc
builds.

<H3> 3.17.4 RX Options </H3>
<!--docid::SEC29::-->
<P>

These command-line options are defined for RX targets:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-m64bit-doubles</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-m32bit-doubles</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX983"></A>
<A NAME="IDX984"></A>
Make the <CODE>double</CODE> data type be 64 bits (<SAMP>`-m64bit-doubles'</SAMP>)
or 32 bits (<SAMP>`-m32bit-doubles'</SAMP>) in size.  The default is
<SAMP>`-m32bit-doubles'</SAMP>.  <EM>Note</EM> RX floating-point hardware only
works on 32-bit values, which is why the default is
<SAMP>`-m32bit-doubles'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpu</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-nofpu</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX985"></A>
<A NAME="IDX986"></A>
Enables (<SAMP>`-fpu'</SAMP>) or disables (<SAMP>`-nofpu'</SAMP>) the use of RX
floating-point hardware.  The default is enabled for the <VAR>RX600</VAR>
series and disabled for the <VAR>RX200</VAR> series.
<P>

Floating-point instructions will only be generated for 32-bit floating-point 
values however, so if the <SAMP>`-m64bit-doubles'</SAMP> option is in
use then the FPU hardware will not be used for doubles.
</P><P>

<EM>Note</EM> If the <SAMP>`-fpu'</SAMP> option is enabled then
<SAMP>`-funsafe-math-optimizations'</SAMP> is also enabled automatically.
This is because the RX FPU instructions are themselves unsafe.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-mcpu=<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX987"></A>
Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted.  Currently three types are
supported, the generic <VAR>RX600</VAR> and <VAR>RX200</VAR> series hardware and
the specific <VAR>RX610</VAR> CPU.  The default is <VAR>RX600</VAR>.
<P>

The only difference between <VAR>RX600</VAR> and <VAR>RX610</VAR> is that the
<VAR>RX610</VAR> does not support the <CODE>MVTIPL</CODE> instruction.
</P><P>

The <VAR>RX200</VAR> series does not have a hardware floating-point unit
and so <SAMP>`-nofpu'</SAMP> is enabled by default when this type is
selected.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-mbig-endian-data</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mlittle-endian-data</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX988"></A>
<A NAME="IDX989"></A>
Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The default is
<SAMP>`-mlittle-endian-data'</SAMP>, i.e. to store data in the little-endian
format.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-msmall-data-limit=<VAR>N</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX990"></A>
Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the RX's
registers (usually <CODE>r13</CODE>) is reserved for use pointing to this
area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables which once
could have been held in the reserved register are now pushed onto the
stack.
<P>

Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.
</P><P>

The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(<SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and
discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See the
description of the <SAMP>`-mpid'</SAMP> option for a description of how the
actual register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-msim</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-sim</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX991"></A>
<A NAME="IDX992"></A>
Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss board
specific runtime.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mas100-syntax</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-as100-syntax</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX993"></A>
<A NAME="IDX994"></A>
When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible with
Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by the GAS
assembler but it has some restrictions so generating it is not the
default option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mmax-constant-size=<VAR>N</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX995"></A>
Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.
<P>

The value <VAR>N</VAR> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)
or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-mrelax</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX996"></A>
Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the
linker will attempt to reduce the size of a program by finding shorter
versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mint-register=<VAR>N</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX997"></A>
Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value <VAR>N</VAR> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register <CODE>r13</CODE> will be reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves <CODE>r13</CODE> and
<CODE>r12</CODE>.  A value of 3 reserves <CODE>r13</CODE>, <CODE>r12</CODE> and
<CODE>r11</CODE>, and a value of 4 reserves <CODE>r13</CODE> through <CODE>r10</CODE>.
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX998"></A>
Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64-bit
multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator as this
makes the interrupt handlers faster.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX999"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1000"></A>
Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more than one
fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.  The default is to
issue a warning for each extra fast interrupt handler found, as the RX
only supports one such interrupt.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mpid</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-pid</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1001"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1002"></A>
Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any
access to constant data will done via an offset from a base address
held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this
option.
<P>

Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually <CODE>r13</CODE>, for
the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated functions.
</P><P>

The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
depends upon whether the <SAMP>`-msmall-data-limit'</SAMP> and/or the
<SAMP>`-mint-register'</SAMP> command-line options are enabled.  Starting
with register <CODE>r13</CODE> and proceeding downwards, registers are
allocated first to satisfy the requirements of <SAMP>`-mint-register'</SAMP>,
then <SAMP>`-mpid'</SAMP> and finally <SAMP>`-msmall-data-limit'</SAMP>.  Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be <CODE>r8</CODE> if both
<SAMP>`-mint-register=4'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-mpid'</SAMP> are specified on the
command line.
</P><P>

By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be restored
via the <SAMP>`-mno-pid'</SAMP> command-line option.
</P><P>

</DL>
<P>

<EM>Note:</EM> The generic GCC command-line option <SAMP>`-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP>
has special significance to the RX port when used with the
<CODE>interrupt</CODE> function attribute.  This attribute indicates a
function intended to process fast interrupts.  GCC will will ensure
that it only uses the registers <CODE>r10</CODE>, <CODE>r11</CODE>, <CODE>r12</CODE>
and/or <CODE>r13</CODE> and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
<SAMP>`-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-mint-register'</SAMP> command-line
options.

<P>

<DT><CODE>-mnomacsave</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1030"></A>
Mark the <CODE>MAC</CODE> register as call-clobbered, even if
<SAMP>`-mhitachi'</SAMP> is given.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mieee</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1031"></A>
Increase IEEE compliance of floating-point code.
At the moment, this is equivalent to <SAMP>`-fno-finite-math-only'</SAMP>.
When generating 16-bit SH opcodes, getting IEEE-conforming results for
comparisons of NANs / infinities incurs extra overhead in every
floating-point comparison, therefore the default is set to
<SAMP>`-ffinite-math-only'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-minline-ic_invalidate</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1032"></A>
Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after setting up
nested function trampolines.
This option has no effect if -musermode is in effect and the selected
code generation option (e.g. -m4) does not allow the use of the icbi
instruction.
If the selected code generation option does not allow the use of the icbi
instruction, and -musermode is not in effect, the inlined code will
manipulate the instruction cache address array directly with an associative
write.  This not only requires privileged mode, but it will also
fail if the cache line had been mapped via the TLB and has become unmapped.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-misize</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1033"></A>
Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mpadstruct</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1034"></A>
This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4 bytes,
which is incompatible with the SH ABI.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-msoft-atomic</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1035"></A>
Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences for the atomic
built-in functions.  The generated atomic sequences require support from the 
interrupt / exception handling code of the system and are only suitable for
single-core systems.  They will not perform correctly on multi-core systems.
This option is enabled by default when the target is <CODE>sh-*-linux*</CODE>.
For details on the atomic built-in functions see <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC115">6.52 Built-in functions for memory model aware atomic operations</A>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mspace</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1036"></A>
Optimize for space instead of speed.  Implied by <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mprefergot</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1037"></A>
When generating position-independent code, emit function calls using
the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage Table.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-musermode</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1038"></A>
Don't generate privileged mode only code; implies -mno-inline-ic_invalidate
if the inlined code would not work in user mode.
This is the default when the target is <CODE>sh-*-linux*</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-multcost=<VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1039"></A>
Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mdiv=<VAR>strategy</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1040"></A>
Set the division strategy to use for SHmedia code.  <VAR>strategy</VAR> must be
one of: call, call2, fp, inv, inv:minlat, inv20u, inv20l, inv:call,
inv:call2, inv:fp .
"fp" performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very high latency,
but needs only a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if
your code has enough easily-exploitable ILP to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating-point instructions together with other instructions.
Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.
"inv" uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor,
and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows
cse and hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
an unspecified result, but does not trap.
"inv:minlat" is a variant of "inv" where if no cse / hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with the
final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with
other code.
"call" calls a library function that usually implements the inv:minlat
strategy.
This gives high code density for m5-*media-nofpu compilations.
"call2" uses a different entry point of the same library function, where it
assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has already been set up, which
exposes the pointer load to cse / code hoisting optimizations.
"inv:call", "inv:call2" and "inv:fp" all use the "inv" algorithm for initial
code generation, but if the code stays unoptimized, revert to the "call",
"call2", or "fp" strategies, respectively.  Note that the
potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is carried by a
separate instruction, so it is possible that all the integer instructions
are hoisted out, but the marker for the side effect stays where it is.
A recombination to fp operations or a call is not possible in that case.
"inv20u" and "inv20l" are variants of the "inv:minlat" strategy.  In the case
that the inverse calculation was nor separated from the multiply, they speed
up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus sign where applicable),
by inserting a test to skip a number of operations in this case; this test
slows down the case of larger dividends.  inv20u assumes the case of a such
a small dividend to be unlikely, and inv20l assumes it to be likely.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1041"></A>
Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function prologue rather
than around each call.  Generally beneficial for performance and size.  Also
needed for unwinding to avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mdivsi3_libfunc=<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1042"></A>
Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed division to
<VAR>name</VAR>.  This only affect the name used in the call and inv:call
division strategies, and the compiler will still expect the same
sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option was not present.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mfixed-range=<VAR>register-range</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1043"></A>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-madjust-unroll</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1044"></A>
Throttle unrolling to avoid thrashing target registers.
This option only has an effect if the gcc code base supports the
TARGET_ADJUST_UNROLL_MAX target hook.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mindexed-addressing</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1045"></A>
Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact.
This is only safe if the hardware and/or OS implement 32-bit wrap-around
semantics for the indexed addressing mode.  The architecture allows the
implementation of processors with 64-bit MMU, which the OS could use to
get 32-bit addressing, but since no current hardware implementation supports
this or any other way to make the indexed addressing mode safe to use in
the 32-bit ABI, the default is <SAMP>`-mno-indexed-addressing'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mgettrcost=<VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1046"></A>
Set the cost assumed for the gettr instruction to <VAR>number</VAR>.
The default is 2 if <SAMP>`-mpt-fixed'</SAMP> is in effect, 100 otherwise.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mpt-fixed</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1047"></A>
Assume pt* instructions won't trap.  This will generally generate better
scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.  The current architecture
definition says that ptabs and ptrel trap when the target anded with 3 is 3.
This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule ptabs /
ptrel before a branch, or hoist it out of a loop.  For example,
__do_global_ctors, a part of libgcc that runs constructors at program
startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by -1.  With the
-mpt-fixed option, the ptabs will be done before testing against -1.
That means that all the constructors will be run a bit quicker, but when
the loop comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because ptabs
loads -1 into a target register.  Since this option is unsafe for any
hardware implementing the current architecture specification, the default
is -mno-pt-fixed.  Unless the user specifies a specific cost with
<SAMP>`-mgettrcost'</SAMP>, -mno-pt-fixed also implies <SAMP>`-mgettrcost=100'</SAMP>;
this deters register allocation using target registers for storing
ordinary integers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-minvalid-symbols</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1048"></A>
Assume symbols might be invalid.  Ordinary function symbols generated by
the compiler will always be valid to load with movi/shori/ptabs or
movi/shori/ptrel, but with assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible
to generate symbols that will cause ptabs / ptrel to trap.
This option is only meaningful when <SAMP>`-mno-pt-fixed'</SAMP> is in effect.
It will then prevent cross-basic-block cse, hoisting and most scheduling
of symbol loads.  The default is <SAMP>`-mno-invalid-symbols'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mbranch-cost=<VAR>num</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1049"></A>
Assume <VAR>num</VAR> to be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher numbers
will make the compiler try to generate more branch-free code if possible.  
If not specified the value is selected depending on the processor type that
is being compiled for.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mcbranchdi</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1050"></A>
Enable the <CODE>cbranchdi4</CODE> instruction pattern.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mcmpeqdi</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1051"></A>
Emit the <CODE>cmpeqdi_t</CODE> instruction pattern even when <SAMP>`-mcbranchdi'</SAMP>
is in effect.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mfused-madd</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1052"></A>
Allow the usage of the <CODE>fmac</CODE> instruction (floating-point
multiply-accumulate) if the processor type supports it.  Enabling this
option might generate code that produces different numeric floating-point
results compared to strict IEEE 754 arithmetic.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mpretend-cmove</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1053"></A>
Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for conditional move instruction
patterns.  This can result in faster code on the SH4 processor.

<H2> 3.18 Options for Code Generation Conventions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC31::-->
<P>

These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
</P><P>

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed--the one that is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <SAMP>`no-'</SAMP> or adding
it.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fbounds-check</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1054"></A>
For front ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ftrapv</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1055"></A>
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fwrapv</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1056"></A>
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front end, as required by the Java language specification.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fexceptions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1057"></A>
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like
C++ that normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't
use exception handling.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fnon-call-exceptions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1058"></A>
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <EM>trapping</EM>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <CODE>SIGALRM</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-funwind-tables</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1059"></A>
Similar to <SAMP>`-fexceptions'</SAMP>, except that it will just generate any needed
static data, but will not affect the generated code in any other way.
You will normally not enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling would enable it on your behalf.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1060"></A>
Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpcc-struct-return</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1061"></A>
Return "short" <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).
<P>

The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.
</P><P>

Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.
</P><P>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> code compiled with the <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<SAMP>`-freg-struct-return'</SAMP> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-freg-struct-return</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1062"></A>
Return <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
<SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>.
<P>

If you specify neither <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> nor
<SAMP>`-freg-struct-return'</SAMP>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>, except on targets where GCC is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.
</P><P>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> code compiled with the <SAMP>`-freg-struct-return'</SAMP>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fshort-enums</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1063"></A>
Allocate to an <CODE>enum</CODE> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <CODE>enum</CODE> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.
<P>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`-fshort-enums'</SAMP> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fshort-double</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1064"></A>
Use the same size for <CODE>double</CODE> as for <CODE>float</CODE>.
<P>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`-fshort-double'</SAMP> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fshort-wchar</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1065"></A>
Override the underlying type for <SAMP>`wchar_t'</SAMP> to be <SAMP>`short
unsigned int'</SAMP> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under WINE.
<P>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`-fshort-wchar'</SAMP> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-common</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1066"></A>
In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global variables.
Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple definitions of
such variables in different compilation units by placing the variables
in a common block.
This is the behavior specified by <SAMP>`-fcommon'</SAMP>, and is the default
for GCC on most targets.
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO C, and on some
targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable references.
The <SAMP>`-fno-common'</SAMP> option specifies that the compiler should place
uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file,
rather than generating them as common blocks.
This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
(without <CODE>extern</CODE>) in two different compilations,
you will get a multiple-definition error when you link them.
In this case, you must compile with <SAMP>`-fcommon'</SAMP> instead.
Compiling with <SAMP>`-fno-common'</SAMP> is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable declarations this way.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-ident</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1067"></A>
Ignore the <SAMP>`#ident'</SAMP> directive.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-finhibit-size-directive</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1068"></A>
Don't output a <CODE>.size</CODE> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fverbose-asm</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1069"></A>
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).
<P>

<SAMP>`-fno-verbose-asm'</SAMP>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-frecord-gcc-switches</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1070"></A>
This switch causes the command line that was used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.  This
switch is related to the <SAMP>`-fverbose-asm'</SAMP> switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also <SAMP>`-grecord-gcc-switches'</SAMP> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpic</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1071"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1072"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1073"></A>
Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP> does not work; in that case, recompile with <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)
<P>

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.
</P><P>

When this flag is set, the macros <CODE>__pic__</CODE> and <CODE>__PIC__</CODE>
are defined to 1.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fPIC</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1074"></A>
If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k,
PowerPC and SPARC.
<P>

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.
</P><P>

When this flag is set, the macros <CODE>__pic__</CODE> and <CODE>__PIC__</CODE>
are defined to 2.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fpie</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fPIE</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1075"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1076"></A>
These options are similar to <SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP>, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used when <SAMP>`-pie'</SAMP> GCC option will be
used during linking.
<P>

<SAMP>`-fpie'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fPIE'</SAMP> both define the macros
<CODE>__pie__</CODE> and <CODE>__PIE__</CODE>.  The macros have the value 1
for <SAMP>`-fpie'</SAMP> and 2 for <SAMP>`-fPIE'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-jump-tables</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1077"></A>
Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with <SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP> for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1078"></A>
Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).
<P>

<VAR>reg</VAR> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <CODE>REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>
macro in the machine description macro file.
</P><P>

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fcall-used-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1079"></A>
Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register <VAR>reg</VAR>.
<P>

It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.
</P><P>

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fcall-saved-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1080"></A>
Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register <VAR>reg</VAR> if they use it.
<P>

It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.
</P><P>

A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.
</P><P>

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fpack-struct[=<VAR>n</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1081"></A>
Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this will be output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.
<P>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`-fpack-struct'</SAMP> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finstrument-functions</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1082"></A>
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<CODE>__builtin_return_address</CODE> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
</P><P>

This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <SAMP>`extern inline'</SAMP> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
</P><P>

A function may be given the attribute <CODE>no_instrument_function</CODE>, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=<VAR>file</VAR>,<VAR>file</VAR>,<small>...</small></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1083"></A>
<P>

Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of <CODE>-finstrument-functions</CODE>).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of <VAR>file</VAR>, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the <VAR>file</VAR> parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.
</P><P>

For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will exclude any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain <CODE>/bits/stl</CODE> or <CODE>include/sys</CODE>.
</P><P>

If, for some reason, you want to include letter <CODE>','</CODE> in one of
<VAR>sym</VAR>, write <CODE>'\,'</CODE>. For example,
<CODE>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list='\,\,tmp'</CODE>
(note the single quote surrounding the option).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=<VAR>sym</VAR>,<VAR>sym</VAR>,<small>...</small></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1084"></A>
<P>

This is similar to <CODE>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</CODE>,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as <CODE>vector&#60;int&#62; blah(const vector&#60;int&#62; &#38;)</CODE>, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., <CODE>_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE</CODE>).  The
match is done on substrings: if the <VAR>sym</VAR> parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not
using universal character names.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fstack-check</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1085"></A>
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
<P>

Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.
</P><P>

You can additionally specify a string parameter: <CODE>no</CODE> means no
checking, <CODE>generic</CODE> means force the use of old-style checking,
<CODE>specific</CODE> means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare <SAMP>`-fstack-check'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they will always be
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.
<P>

<LI>
Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.
<P>

<LI>
Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, the performances of the code are hampered.
</OL>
<P>

Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
<CODE>specific</CODE> if no target support has been added in the compiler.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fstack-limit-register=<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fstack-limit-symbol=<VAR>sym</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-stack-limit</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1086"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1087"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1088"></A>
Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.
<P>

For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <SAMP>`0x80000000'</SAMP>
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<SAMP>`-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000'</SAMP> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsplit-stack</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1089"></A>
Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the i386 and x86_64 back ends running
GNU/Linux.
<P>

When code compiled with <SAMP>`-fsplit-stack'</SAMP> calls code compiled
without <SAMP>`-fsplit-stack'</SAMP>, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with <SAMP>`-fsplit-stack'</SAMP> is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without <SAMP>`-fsplit-stack'</SAMP> always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21
and later.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fleading-underscore</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1090"></A>
This option and its counterpart, <SAMP>`-fno-leading-underscore'</SAMP>, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.
<P>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`-fleading-underscore'</SAMP> switch causes GCC to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ftls-model=<VAR>model</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1091"></A>
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC130">6.58 Thread-Local Storage</A>).
The <VAR>model</VAR> argument should be one of <CODE>global-dynamic</CODE>,
<CODE>local-dynamic</CODE>, <CODE>initial-exec</CODE> or <CODE>local-exec</CODE>.
<P>

The default without <SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP> is <CODE>initial-exec</CODE>; with
<SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP> the default is <CODE>global-dynamic</CODE>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fvisibility=<VAR>default|internal|hidden|protected</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1092"></A>
Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option--all
symbols will be marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is <STRONG>strongly</STRONG> recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.
<P>

Despite the nomenclature, <CODE>default</CODE> always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
<CODE>protected</CODE> and <CODE>internal</CODE> are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option will be <CODE>hidden</CODE>.
The default if <SAMP>`-fvisibility'</SAMP> isn't specified is
<CODE>default</CODE>, i.e., make every
symbol public--this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
GCC.
</P><P>

A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
symbols have the correct visibility is given by "How To Write
Shared Libraries" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/">http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/</A>)---however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLL's on Windows and with <SAMP>`-fvisibility=hidden'</SAMP>
and <CODE>__attribute__ ((visibility("default")))</CODE> instead of
<CODE>__declspec(dllexport)</CODE> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.
</P><P>

For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC visibility'</SAMP> of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC visibility pop'</SAMP>.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed <STRONG>as
part of the API interface contract</STRONG> and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local DSO should <STRONG>always</STRONG> be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection overheads--making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to ISO C++ specification requirements, operator new and
operator delete must always be of default visibility.
</P><P>

Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say <SAMP>`#pragma GCC visibility push(default)'</SAMP>
before including any such headers.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`extern'</SAMP> declarations are not affected by <SAMP>`-fvisibility'</SAMP>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with <SAMP>`-fvisibility=hidden'</SAMP> with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to <SAMP>`extern'</SAMP>
functions with no explicit visibility will use the PLT, so it is more
effective to use <SAMP>`__attribute ((visibility))'</SAMP> and/or
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC visibility'</SAMP> to tell the compiler which <SAMP>`extern'</SAMP>
declarations should be treated as hidden.
</P><P>

Note that <SAMP>`-fvisibility'</SAMP> does affect C++ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that will
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the <SAMP>`type_info'</SAMP> nodes will be unified between
the DSOs.
</P><P>

An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/@/wiki/@/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.org/@/wiki/@/Visibility</A>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1093"></A>
This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag the user could
declare all peripheral bit-fields as "unsigned short" (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.
<P>

If this option is disabled, the compiler will use the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
instruction, even though that will access bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.
</P><P>

If the target requires strict alignment, and honoring the field
type would require violating this alignment, a warning is issued.
If the field has <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute, the access is done without
honoring the field type.  If the field doesn't have <CODE>packed</CODE>
attribute, the access is done honoring the field type.  In both cases,
GCC assumes that the user knows something about the target hardware
that it is unaware of.
</P><P>

The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.

<H2> 3.19 Environment Variables Affecting GCC </H2>
<!--docid::SEC32::-->
<P>

This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
</P><P>

Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC22">3.14 Options for Directory Search</A>).  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC.
See section `Controlling the Compilation Driver <TT>`gcc'</TT>' in <CITE>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals</CITE>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>LANG</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>LC_ALL</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1094"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1095"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1096"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1097"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1098"></A>
These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information which allows GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
<CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> and <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <SAMP>`en_GB.UTF-8'</SAMP> for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.
<P>

The <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.
</P><P>

The <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
</P><P>

If the <CODE>LC_ALL</CODE> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> and <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE>; otherwise, <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE>
and <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE> default to the value of the <CODE>LANG</CODE>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1099"></A>
If <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
<P>

<DT><CODE>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1100"></A>
Setting <CODE>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</CODE> is nearly equivalent to passing
<SAMP>`-fcompare-debug'</SAMP> to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.
<P>

<DT><CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1101"></A>
If <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
<P>

If <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is not set, GCC will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
</P><P>

If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
</P><P>

The default value of <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is
<TT>`<VAR>prefix</VAR>/lib/gcc/'</TT> where <VAR>prefix</VAR> is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases <VAR>prefix</VAR> is the value
of <CODE>prefix</CODE> when you ran the <TT>`configure'</TT> script.
</P><P>

Other prefixes specified with <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> take precedence over this prefix.
</P><P>

This prefix is also used for finding files such as <TT>`crt0.o'</TT> that are
used for linking.
</P><P>

In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <SAMP>`/usr/local/lib/gcc'</SAMP>
(more precisely, with the value of <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <SAMP>`-Bfoo/'</SAMP>, GCC will search
<TT>`foo/bar'</TT> where it would normally search <TT>`/usr/local/lib/bar'</TT>.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next. If a standard directory begins with the configured
<VAR>prefix</VAR> then the value of <VAR>prefix</VAR> is replaced by
<CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> when looking for header files.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1102"></A>
The value of <CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1103"></A>
The value of <CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  When configured as a native compiler,
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option (but directories specified with
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> come first).
<P>

<DT><CODE>LANG</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1105"></A>
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C++.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <CODE>LANG</CODE> are recognized:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`C-JIS'</SAMP>
<DD>Recognize JIS characters.
<DT><SAMP>`C-SJIS'</SAMP>
<DD>Recognize SJIS characters.
<DT><SAMP>`C-EUCJP'</SAMP>
<DD>Recognize EUCJP characters.
</DL>
<P>

If <CODE>LANG</CODE> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
</DL>
<P>

Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1106"></A>
<DT><CODE>CPATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1107"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1108"></A>
<DT><CODE>C_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1110"></A>
<DT><CODE>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1111"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1112"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1113"></A>
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>, in which to look for header files.
The special character, <CODE>PATH_SEPARATOR</CODE>, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
<P>

<CODE>CPATH</CODE> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>, but after any paths given with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
</P><P>

The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <SAMP>`-isystem'</SAMP>, but after any
paths given with <SAMP>`-isystem'</SAMP> options on the command line.
</P><P>

In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
<CODE>CPATH</CODE> is <CODE>:/special/include</CODE>, that has the same
effect as <SAMP>`-I. -I/special/include'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1114"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1116"></A>
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
<P>

The value of <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<SAMP>`<VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP>, in which case the rules are written to
file <VAR>file</VAR> using <VAR>target</VAR> as the target name.
</P><P>

In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options <SAMP>`-MM'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-MF'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC19">3.11 Options Controlling the Preprocessor</A>),
with an optional <SAMP>`-MT'</SAMP> switch too.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1117"></A>
<DT><CODE>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1119"></A>
This variable is the same as <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
<SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> rather than <SAMP>`-MM'</SAMP>.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC19">3.11 Options Controlling the Preprocessor</A>.

<H2> 3.20 Using Precompiled Headers </H2>
<!--docid::SEC33::-->
<P>

Often large projects have many header files that are included in every
source file.  The time the compiler takes to process these header files
over and over again can account for nearly all of the time required to
build the project.  To make builds faster, GCC allows users to
`precompile' a header file; then, if builds can use the precompiled
header file they will be much faster.
</P><P>

To create a precompiled header file, simply compile it as you would any
other file, if necessary using the <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option to make the driver
treat it as a C or C++ header file.  You will probably want to use a
tool like <CODE>make</CODE> to keep the precompiled header up-to-date when
the headers it contains change.
</P><P>

A precompiled header file will be searched for when <CODE>#include</CODE> is
seen in the compilation.  As it searches for the included file
(see section `Search Path' in <CITE>The C Preprocessor</CITE>) the
compiler looks for a precompiled header in each directory just before it
looks for the include file in that directory.  The name searched for is
the name specified in the <CODE>#include</CODE> with <SAMP>`.gch'</SAMP> appended.  If
the precompiled header file can't be used, it is ignored.
</P><P>

For instance, if you have <CODE>#include "all.h"</CODE>, and you have
<TT>`all.h.gch'</TT> in the same directory as <TT>`all.h'</TT>, then the
precompiled header file will be used if possible, and the original
header will be used otherwise.
</P><P>

Alternatively, you might decide to put the precompiled header file in a
directory and use <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> to ensure that directory is searched
before (or instead of) the directory containing the original header.
Then, if you want to check that the precompiled header file is always
used, you can put a file of the same name as the original header in this
directory containing an <CODE>#error</CODE> command.
</P><P>

This also works with <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP>.  So yet another way to use
precompiled headers, good for projects not designed with precompiled
header files in mind, is to simply take most of the header files used by
a project, include them from another header file, precompile that header
file, and <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> the precompiled header.  If the header files
have guards against multiple inclusion, they will be skipped because
they've already been included (in the precompiled header).
</P><P>

If you need to precompile the same header file for different
languages, targets, or compiler options, you can instead make a
<EM>directory</EM> named like <TT>`all.h.gch'</TT>, and put each precompiled
header in the directory, perhaps using <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>.  It doesn't matter
what you call the files in the directory, every precompiled header in
the directory will be considered.  The first precompiled header
encountered in the directory that is valid for this compilation will
be used; they're searched in no particular order.
</P><P>

There are many other possibilities, limited only by your imagination,
good sense, and the constraints of your build system.
</P><P>

A precompiled header file can be used only when these conditions apply:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Only one precompiled header can be used in a particular compilation.
<P>

<LI>
A precompiled header can't be used once the first C token is seen.  You
can have preprocessor directives before a precompiled header; you can
even include a precompiled header from inside another header, so long as
there are no C tokens before the <CODE>#include</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
The precompiled header file must be produced for the same language as
the current compilation.  You can't use a C precompiled header for a C++
compilation.
<P>

<LI>
The precompiled header file must have been produced by the same compiler
binary as the current compilation is using.
<P>

<LI>
Any macros defined before the precompiled header is included must
either be defined in the same way as when the precompiled header was
generated, or must not affect the precompiled header, which usually
means that they don't appear in the precompiled header at all.
<P>

The <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> option is one way to define a macro before a
precompiled header is included; using a <CODE>#define</CODE> can also do it.
There are also some options that define macros implicitly, like
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Wdeprecated'</SAMP>; the same rule applies to macros
defined this way.
</P><P>

<LI>If debugging information is output when using the precompiled
header, using <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> or similar, the same kind of debugging information
must have been output when building the precompiled header.  However,
a precompiled header built using <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> can be used in a compilation
when no debugging information is being output.
<P>

<LI>The same <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> options must generally be used when building
and using the precompiled header.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC25">3.17 Hardware Models and Configurations</A>,
for any cases where this rule is relaxed.
<P>

<LI>Each of the following options must be the same when building and using
the precompiled header:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>-fexceptions
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
Some other command-line options starting with <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-p'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> must be defined in the same way as when
the precompiled header was generated.  At present, it's not clear
which options are safe to change and which are not; the safest choice
is to use exactly the same options when generating and using the
precompiled header.  The following are known to be safe:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{-fmessage-length=  -fpreprocessed  -fsched-interblock 
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table>-fsched-spec  -fsched-spec-load  -fsched-spec-load-dangerous 
-fsched-verbose=<VAR>number</VAR>  -fschedule-insns  -fvisibility= 
-pedantic-errors}
</P><P>

</UL>
<P>

For all of these except the last, the compiler will automatically
ignore the precompiled header if the conditions aren't met.  If you
find an option combination that doesn't work and doesn't cause the
precompiled header to be ignored, please consider filing a bug report,
see <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC192">12. Reporting Bugs</A>.
</P><P>

If you do use differing options when generating and using the
precompiled header, the actual behavior will be a mixture of the
behavior for the options.  For instance, if you use <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> to
generate the precompiled header but not when using it, you may or may
not get debugging information for routines in the precompiled header.

<H1> 4. C Implementation-defined behavior </H1>
<!--docid::SEC34::-->
<P>

A conforming implementation of ISO C is required to document its
choice of behavior in each of the areas that are designated
"implementation defined".  The following lists all such areas,
along with the section numbers from the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 and ISO/IEC
9899:1999 standards.  Some areas are only implementation-defined in
one version of the standard.
</P><P>

Some choices depend on the externally determined ABI for the platform
(including standard character encodings) which GCC follows; these are
listed as "determined by ABI" below.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC170">Binary Compatibility</A>, and <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</A>.  Some
choices are documented in the preprocessor manual.
See section `Implementation-defined behavior' in <CITE>The C Preprocessor</CITE>.  Some choices are made by the
library and operating system (or other environment when compiling for
a freestanding environment); refer to their documentation for details.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>
<CITE>What constitutes an access to an object that has volatile-qualified
type (C90 6.5.3, C99 6.7.3).</CITE>
<P>

Such an object is normally accessed by pointers and used for accessing
hardware.  In most expressions, it is intuitively obvious what is a read
and what is a write.  For example
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>volatile int *dst = <VAR>somevalue</VAR>;
volatile int *src = <VAR>someothervalue</VAR>;
*dst = *src;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will cause a read of the volatile object pointed to by <VAR>src</VAR> and store the
value into the volatile object pointed to by <VAR>dst</VAR>.  There is no
guarantee that these reads and writes are atomic, especially for objects
larger than <CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

However, if the volatile storage is not being modified, and the value of
the volatile storage is not used, then the situation is less obvious.
For example
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>volatile int *src = <VAR>somevalue</VAR>;
*src;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

According to the C standard, such an expression is an rvalue whose type
is the unqualified version of its original type, i.e. <CODE>int</CODE>.  Whether
GCC interprets this as a read of the volatile object being pointed to or
only as a request to evaluate the expression for its side-effects depends
on this type.
</P><P>

If it is a scalar type, or on most targets an aggregate type whose only
member object is of a scalar type, or a union type whose member objects
are of scalar types, the expression is interpreted by GCC as a read of
the volatile object; in the other cases, the expression is only evaluated
for its side-effects.

<H1> 5. C++ Implementation-defined behavior </H1>
<!--docid::SEC51::-->
<P>

A conforming implementation of ISO C++ is required to document its
choice of behavior in each of the areas that are designated
"implementation defined".  The following lists all such areas,
along with the section numbers from the ISO/IEC 14822:1998 and ISO/IEC
14822:2003 standards.  Some areas are only implementation-defined in
one version of the standard.
</P><P>

Some choices depend on the externally determined ABI for the platform
(including standard character encodings) which GCC follows; these are
listed as "determined by ABI" below.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC170">Binary Compatibility</A>, and <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</A>.  Some
choices are documented in the preprocessor manual.
See section `Implementation-defined behavior' in <CITE>The C Preprocessor</CITE>.  Some choices are documented in
the corresponding document for the C language.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC34">4. C Implementation-defined behavior</A>.  Some choices are made by the library and operating
system (or other environment when compiling for a freestanding
environment); refer to their documentation for details.

<H1> 6. Extensions to the C Language Family </H1>
<!--docid::SEC54::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1124"></A>
GNU C provides several language features not found in ISO standard C.
(The <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> option directs GCC to print a warning message if
any of these features is used.)  To test for the availability of these
features in conditional compilation, check for a predefined macro
<CODE>__GNUC__</CODE>, which is always defined under GCC.
</P><P>

These extensions are available in C and Objective-C.  Most of them are
also available in C++.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC134">Extensions to the C++ Language</A>, for extensions that apply <EM>only</EM> to C++.
</P><P>

Some features that are in ISO C99 but not C90 or C++ are also, as
extensions, accepted by GCC in C90 mode and in C++.

<H2> 6.1 Statements and Declarations in Expressions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC55::-->
<P>

A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.
</P><P>

Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>({ int y = foo (); int z;
   if (y &#62; 0) z = y;
   else z = - y;
   z; })
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <CODE>foo ()</CODE>.
</P><P>

The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <CODE>void</CODE>, and thus
effectively no value.)
</P><P>

This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe" (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define max(a,b) ((a) &#62; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1125"></A>
But this definition computes either <VAR>a</VAR> or <VAR>b</VAR> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here taken as <CODE>int</CODE>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define maxint(a,b) \
  ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &#62; _b ? _a : _b; })
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit-field, or
the initial value of a static variable.
</P><P>

If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <CODE>typeof</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC60">6.6 Referring to a Type with <CODE>typeof</CODE></A>).
</P><P>

In G++, the result value of a statement expression undergoes array and
function pointer decay, and is returned by value to the enclosing
expression.  For instance, if <CODE>A</CODE> is a class, then
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>        A a;

        ({a;}).Foo ()
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will construct a temporary <CODE>A</CODE> object to hold the result of the
statement expression, and that will be used to invoke <CODE>Foo</CODE>.
Therefore the <CODE>this</CODE> pointer observed by <CODE>Foo</CODE> will not be the
address of <CODE>a</CODE>.
</P><P>

Any temporaries created within a statement within a statement expression
will be destroyed at the statement's end.  This makes statement
expressions inside macros slightly different from function calls.  In
the latter case temporaries introduced during argument evaluation will
be destroyed at the end of the statement that includes the function
call.  In the statement expression case they will be destroyed during
the statement expression.  For instance,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define macro(a)  ({__typeof__(a) b = (a); b + 3; })
template&#60;typename T&#62; T function(T a) { T b = a; return b + 3; }

void foo ()
{
  macro (X ());
  function (X ());
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will have different places where temporaries are destroyed.  For the
<CODE>macro</CODE> case, the temporary <CODE>X</CODE> will be destroyed just after
the initialization of <CODE>b</CODE>.  In the <CODE>function</CODE> case that
temporary will be destroyed when the function returns.
</P><P>

These considerations mean that it is probably a bad idea to use
statement-expressions of this form in header files that are designed to
work with C++.  (Note that some versions of the GNU C Library contained
header files using statement-expression that lead to precisely this
bug.)
</P><P>

Jumping into a statement expression with <CODE>goto</CODE> or using a
<CODE>switch</CODE> statement outside the statement expression with a
<CODE>case</CODE> or <CODE>default</CODE> label inside the statement expression is
not permitted.  Jumping into a statement expression with a computed
<CODE>goto</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC57">6.3 Labels as Values</A>) yields undefined behavior.
Jumping out of a statement expression is permitted, but if the
statement expression is part of a larger expression then it is
unspecified which other subexpressions of that expression have been
evaluated except where the language definition requires certain
subexpressions to be evaluated before or after the statement
expression.  In any case, as with a function call the evaluation of a
statement expression is not interleaved with the evaluation of other
parts of the containing expression.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  foo (), (({ bar1 (); goto a; 0; }) + bar2 ()), baz();
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will call <CODE>foo</CODE> and <CODE>bar1</CODE> and will not call <CODE>baz</CODE> but
may or may not call <CODE>bar2</CODE>.  If <CODE>bar2</CODE> is called, it will be
called after <CODE>foo</CODE> and before <CODE>bar1</CODE>

<H2> 6.2 Locally Declared Labels </H2>
<!--docid::SEC56::-->
<P>

GCC allows you to declare <EM>local labels</EM> in any nested block
scope.  A local label is just like an ordinary label, but you can
only reference it (with a <CODE>goto</CODE> statement, or by taking its
address) within the block in which it was declared.
</P><P>

A local label declaration looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>__label__ <VAR>label</VAR>;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

or
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>__label__ <VAR>label1</VAR>, <VAR>label2</VAR>, /* <small>...</small> */;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the block,
before any ordinary declarations or statements.
</P><P>

The label declaration defines the label <EM>name</EM>, but does not define
the label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with
<CODE><VAR>label</VAR>:</CODE>, within the statements of the statement expression.
</P><P>

The local label feature is useful for complex macros.  If a macro
contains nested loops, a <CODE>goto</CODE> can be useful for breaking out of
them.  However, an ordinary label whose scope is the whole function
cannot be used: if the macro can be expanded several times in one
function, the label will be multiply defined in that function.  A
local label avoids this problem.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define SEARCH(value, array, target)              \
do {                                              \
  __label__ found;                                \
  typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
  typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
  int i, j;                                       \
  int value;                                      \
  for (i = 0; i &#60; max; i++)                       \
    for (j = 0; j &#60; max; j++)                     \
      if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
        { (value) = i; goto found; }              \
  (value) = -1;                                   \
 found:;                                          \
} while (0)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This could also be written using a statement-expression:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
({                                                \
  __label__ found;                                \
  typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
  typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
  int i, j;                                       \
  int value;                                      \
  for (i = 0; i &#60; max; i++)                       \
    for (j = 0; j &#60; max; j++)                     \
      if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
        { value = i; goto found; }                \
  value = -1;                                     \
 found:                                           \
  value;                                          \
})
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Local label declarations also make the labels they declare visible to
nested functions, if there are any.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC58">6.4 Nested Functions</A>, for details.

<H2> 6.3 Labels as Values </H2>
<!--docid::SEC57::-->
<P>

You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
(or a containing function) with the unary operator <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP>.  The
value has type <CODE>void *</CODE>.  This value is a constant and can be used
wherever a constant of that type is valid.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void *ptr;
/* <small>...</small> */
ptr = &#38;&#38;foo;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is done
with the computed goto statement<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="gcc.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>, <CODE>goto *<VAR>exp</VAR>;</CODE>.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>goto *ptr;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Any expression of type <CODE>void *</CODE> is allowed.
</P><P>

One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array that
will serve as a jump table:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static void *array[] = { &#38;&#38;foo, &#38;&#38;bar, &#38;&#38;hack };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>goto *array[i];
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds--array
indexing in C never does that.
</P><P>

Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
<CODE>switch</CODE> statement.  The <CODE>switch</CODE> statement is cleaner, so
use that rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a
<CODE>switch</CODE> statement very well.
</P><P>

Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code.
The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the
threaded code for super-fast dispatching.
</P><P>

You may not use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function.
If you do that, totally unpredictable things will happen.  The best way to
avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables and
never pass it as an argument.
</P><P>

An alternate way to write the above example is
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static const int array[] = { &#38;&#38;foo - &#38;&#38;foo, &#38;&#38;bar - &#38;&#38;foo,
                             &#38;&#38;hack - &#38;&#38;foo };
goto *(&#38;&#38;foo + array[i]);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is more friendly to code living in shared libraries, as it reduces
the number of dynamic relocations that are needed, and by consequence,
allows the data to be read-only.
</P><P>

The <CODE>&#38;&#38;foo</CODE> expressions for the same label might have different
values if the containing function is inlined or cloned.  If a program
relies on them being always the same,
<CODE>__attribute__((__noinline__,__noclone__))</CODE> should be used to
prevent inlining and cloning.  If <CODE>&#38;&#38;foo</CODE> is used in a static
variable initializer, inlining and cloning is forbidden.

<H2> 6.4 Nested Functions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC58::-->
<P>

A <EM>nested function</EM> is a function defined inside another function.
(Nested functions are not supported for GNU C++.)  The nested function's
name is local to the block where it is defined.  For example, here we
define a nested function named <CODE>square</CODE>, and call it twice:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>foo (double a, double b)
{
  double square (double z) { return z * z; }

  return square (a) + square (b);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
called <EM>lexical scoping</EM>.  For example, here we show a nested
function which uses an inherited variable named <CODE>offset</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  int access (int *array, int index)
    { return array[index + offset]; }
  int i;
  /* <small>...</small> */
  for (i = 0; i &#60; size; i++)
    /* <small>...</small> */ access (array, i) /* <small>...</small> */
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Nested function definitions are permitted within functions in the places
where variable definitions are allowed; that is, in any block, mixed
with the other declarations and statements in the block.
</P><P>

It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of its
name by storing its address or passing the address to another function:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>hack (int *array, int size)
{
  void store (int index, int value)
    { array[index] = value; }

  intermediate (store, size);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here, the function <CODE>intermediate</CODE> receives the address of
<CODE>store</CODE> as an argument.  If <CODE>intermediate</CODE> calls <CODE>store</CODE>,
the arguments given to <CODE>store</CODE> are used to store into <CODE>array</CODE>.
But this technique works only so long as the containing function
(<CODE>hack</CODE>, in this example) does not exit.
</P><P>

If you try to call the nested function through its address after the
containing function has exited, all hell will break loose.  If you try
to call it after a containing scope level has exited, and if it refers
to some of the variables that are no longer in scope, you may be lucky,
but it's not wise to take the risk.  If, however, the nested function
does not refer to anything that has gone out of scope, you should be
safe.
</P><P>

GCC implements taking the address of a nested function using a technique
called <EM>trampolines</EM>.  This technique was described in
<CITE>Lexical Closures for C++</CITE> (Thomas M. Breuel, USENIX
C++ Conference Proceedings, October 17-21, 1988).
</P><P>

A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
function, provided the label was explicitly declared in the containing
function (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC56">6.2 Locally Declared Labels</A>).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
containing function, exiting the nested function which did the
<CODE>goto</CODE> and any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  __label__ failure;
  int access (int *array, int index)
    {
      if (index &#62; size)
        goto failure;
      return array[index + offset];
    }
  int i;
  /* <small>...</small> */
  for (i = 0; i &#60; size; i++)
    /* <small>...</small> */ access (array, i) /* <small>...</small> */
  /* <small>...</small> */
  return 0;

 /* Control comes here from <CODE>access</CODE>
    if it detects an error.  */
 failure:
  return -1;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A nested function always has no linkage.  Declaring one with
<CODE>extern</CODE> or <CODE>static</CODE> is erroneous.  If you need to declare the nested function
before its definition, use <CODE>auto</CODE> (which is otherwise meaningless
for function declarations).
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  __label__ failure;
  auto int access (int *, int);
  /* <small>...</small> */
  int access (int *array, int index)
    {
      if (index &#62; size)
        goto failure;
      return array[index + offset];
    }
  /* <small>...</small> */

<H2> 6.5 Constructing Function Calls </H2>
<!--docid::SEC59::-->
<P>

Using the built-in functions described below, you can record
the arguments a function received, and call another function
with the same arguments, without knowing the number or types
of the arguments.
</P><P>

You can also record the return value of that function call,
and later return that value, without knowing what data type
the function tried to return (as long as your caller expects
that data type).
</P><P>

However, these built-in functions may interact badly with some
sophisticated features or other extensions of the language.  It
is, therefore, not recommended to use them outside very simple
functions acting as mere forwarders for their arguments.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1126"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void * <B>__builtin_apply_args</B> <I>()</I>
<DD>This built-in function returns a pointer to data
describing how to perform a call with the same arguments as were passed
to the current function.
</P><P>

The function saves the arg pointer register, structure value address,
and all registers that might be used to pass arguments to a function
into a block of memory allocated on the stack.  Then it returns the
address of that block.
</DL>
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1127"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void * <B>__builtin_apply</B> <I>(void (*<VAR>function</VAR>)(), void *<VAR>arguments</VAR>, size_t <VAR>size</VAR>)</I>
<DD>This built-in function invokes <VAR>function</VAR>
with a copy of the parameters described by <VAR>arguments</VAR>
and <VAR>size</VAR>.
</P><P>

The value of <VAR>arguments</VAR> should be the value returned by
<CODE>__builtin_apply_args</CODE>.  The argument <VAR>size</VAR> specifies the size
of the stack argument data, in bytes.
</P><P>

This function returns a pointer to data describing
how to return whatever value was returned by <VAR>function</VAR>.  The data
is saved in a block of memory allocated on the stack.
</P><P>

It is not always simple to compute the proper value for <VAR>size</VAR>.  The
value is used by <CODE>__builtin_apply</CODE> to compute the amount of data
that should be pushed on the stack and copied from the incoming argument
area.

returned by <CODE>__builtin_apply</CODE>.

<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U>  <B>__builtin_va_arg_pack</B> <I>()</I>
<DD>This built-in function represents all anonymous arguments of an inline

inlined, never compiled as a separate function, such as those using
<CODE>__attribute__ ((__always_inline__))</CODE> or
<CODE>__attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__))</CODE> extern inline functions.
It must be only passed as last argument to some other function
with variable arguments.  This is useful for writing small wrapper
inlines for variable argument functions, when using preprocessor
macros is undesirable.  For example:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern int myprintf (FILE *f, const char *format, ...);
extern inline __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)) int
myprintf (FILE *f, const char *format, ...)
{
  int r = fprintf (f, "myprintf: ");
  if (r &#60; 0)
    return r;
  int s = fprintf (f, format, __builtin_va_arg_pack ());
  if (s &#60; 0)
    return s;
  return r + s;
}

</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1130"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> size_t <B>__builtin_va_arg_pack_len</B> <I>()</I>
<DD>This built-in function returns the number of anonymous arguments of
an inline function.  It can be used only in inline functions which
will be always inlined, never compiled as a separate function, such
as those using <CODE>__attribute__ ((__always_inline__))</CODE> or

<H2> 6.6 Referring to a Type with <CODE>typeof</CODE> </H2>
<!--docid::SEC60::-->
<P>

Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
The syntax of using of this keyword looks like <CODE>sizeof</CODE>, but the
construct acts semantically like a type name defined with <CODE>typedef</CODE>.
</P><P>

There are two ways of writing the argument to <CODE>typeof</CODE>: with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typeof (x[0](1))
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This assumes that <CODE>x</CODE> is an array of pointers to functions;
the type described is that of the values of the functions.
</P><P>

Here is an example with a typename as the argument:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typeof (int *)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the type described is that of pointers to <CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

If you are writing a header file that must work when included in ISO C
programs, write <CODE>__typeof__</CODE> instead of <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC108">6.45 Alternate Keywords</A>.
</P><P>

A <CODE>typeof</CODE>-construct can be used anywhere a typedef name could be
used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or inside
of <CODE>sizeof</CODE> or <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
</P><P>

The operand of <CODE>typeof</CODE> is evaluated for its side effects if and
only if it is an expression of variably modified type or the name of
such a type.
</P><P>

<CODE>typeof</CODE> is often useful in conjunction with the
statements-within-expressions feature.  Here is how the two together can
be used to define a safe "maximum" macro that operates on any
arithmetic type and evaluates each of its arguments exactly once:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define max(a,b) \
  ({ typeof (a) _a = (a); \
      typeof (b) _b = (b); \
    _a &#62; _b ? _a : _b; })
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1131"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1132"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1133"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1134"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1135"></A>
</P><P>

The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within the
expressions that are substituted for <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE>.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to declare
variables whose scopes start only after their initializers; this will be a
more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.
</P><P>

Some more examples of the use of <CODE>typeof</CODE>:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
This declares <CODE>y</CODE> with the type of what <CODE>x</CODE> points to.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typeof (*x) y;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
This declares <CODE>y</CODE> as an array of such values.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typeof (*x) y[4];
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
This declares <CODE>y</CODE> as an array of pointers to characters:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>char *y[4];
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

To see the meaning of the declaration using <CODE>typeof</CODE>, and why it
might be a useful way to write, rewrite it with these macros:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
#define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>array (pointer (char), 4) y;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Thus, <CODE>array (pointer (char), 4)</CODE> is the type of arrays of 4
pointers to <CODE>char</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>

<EM>Compatibility Note:</EM> In addition to <CODE>typeof</CODE>, GCC 2 supported
a more limited extension which permitted one to write
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef <VAR>T</VAR> = <VAR>expr</VAR>;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

with the effect of declaring <VAR>T</VAR> to have the type of the expression
<VAR>expr</VAR>.  This extension does not work with GCC 3 (versions between
3.0 and 3.2 will crash; 3.2.1 and later give an error).  Code which
relies on it should be rewritten to use <CODE>typeof</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef typeof(<VAR>expr</VAR>) <VAR>T</VAR>;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This will work with all versions of GCC.

<H2> 6.7 Conditionals with Omitted Operands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC61::-->
<P>

The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then
if the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the conditional
expression.
</P><P>

Therefore, the expression
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>x ? : y
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

has the value of <CODE>x</CODE> if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of
<CODE>y</CODE>.
</P><P>

This example is perfectly equivalent to
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1136"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1137"></A>
In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand does,
or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then repeating
the operand in the middle would perform the side effect twice.  Omitting
the middle operand uses the value already computed without the undesirable
effects of recomputing it.

<H2> 6.9 Double-Word Integers </H2>
<!--docid::SEC63::-->
<P>

ISO C99 supports data types for integers that are at least 64 bits wide,
and as an extension GCC supports them in C90 mode and in C++.
Simply write <CODE>long long int</CODE> for a signed integer, or
<CODE>unsigned long long int</CODE> for an unsigned integer.  To make an
integer constant of type <CODE>long long int</CODE>, add the suffix <SAMP>`LL'</SAMP>
to the integer.  To make an integer constant of type <CODE>unsigned long
long int</CODE>, add the suffix <SAMP>`ULL'</SAMP> to the integer.
</P><P>

You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types.
Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types
are open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded
if the machine supports fullword-to-doubleword a widening multiply
instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
special library routines that come with GCC.
</P><P>

There may be pitfalls when you use <CODE>long long</CODE> types for function
arguments, unless you declare function prototypes.  If a function
expects type <CODE>int</CODE> for its argument, and you pass a value of type
<CODE>long long int</CODE>, confusion will result because the caller and the
subroutine will disagree about the number of bytes for the argument.
Likewise, if the function expects <CODE>long long int</CODE> and you pass
<CODE>int</CODE>.  The best way to avoid such problems is to use prototypes.

<H2> 6.10 Complex Numbers </H2>
<!--docid::SEC64::-->
<P>

ISO C99 supports complex floating data types, and as an extension GCC
supports them in C90 mode and in C++, and supports complex integer data
types which are not part of ISO C99.  You can declare complex types
using the keyword <CODE>_Complex</CODE>.  As an extension, the older GNU
keyword <CODE>__complex__</CODE> is also supported.
</P><P>

For example, <SAMP>`_Complex double x;'</SAMP> declares <CODE>x</CODE> as a
variable whose real part and imaginary part are both of type
<CODE>double</CODE>.  <SAMP>`_Complex short int y;'</SAMP> declares <CODE>y</CODE> to
have real and imaginary parts of type <CODE>short int</CODE>; this is not
likely to be useful, but it shows that the set of complex types is
complete.
</P><P>

To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`j'</SAMP> (either one; they are equivalent).  For example, <CODE>2.5fi</CODE>
has type <CODE>_Complex float</CODE> and <CODE>3i</CODE> has type
<CODE>_Complex int</CODE>.  Such a constant always has a pure imaginary
value, but you can form any complex value you like by adding one to a
real constant.  This is a GNU extension; if you have an ISO C99
conforming C library (such as GNU libc), and want to construct complex
constants of floating type, you should include <CODE>&#60;complex.h&#62;</CODE> and
use the macros <CODE>I</CODE> or <CODE>_Complex_I</CODE> instead.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1139"></A>
To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression <VAR>exp</VAR>, write
<CODE>__real__ <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>.  Likewise, use <CODE>__imag__</CODE> to
extract the imaginary part.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <CODE>crealf</CODE>,
<CODE>creal</CODE>, <CODE>creall</CODE>, <CODE>cimagf</CODE>, <CODE>cimag</CODE> and
<CODE>cimagl</CODE>, declared in <CODE>&#60;complex.h&#62;</CODE> and also provided as
built-in functions by GCC.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1140"></A>
The operator <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> performs complex conjugation when used on a value
with a complex type.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <CODE>conjf</CODE>,
<CODE>conj</CODE> and <CODE>conjl</CODE>, declared in <CODE>&#60;complex.h&#62;</CODE> and also
provided as built-in functions by GCC.
</P><P>

GCC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice-versa).  Only the DWARF2
debug info format can represent this, so use of DWARF2 is recommended.
If you are using the stabs debug info format, GCC describes a noncontiguous
complex variable as if it were two separate variables of noncomplex type.
If the variable's actual name is <CODE>foo</CODE>, the two fictitious
variables are named <CODE>foo$real</CODE> and <CODE>foo$imag</CODE>.  You can
examine and set these two fictitious variables with your debugger.

<H2> 6.11 Additional Floating Types </H2>
<!--docid::SEC65::-->
<P>

As an extension, the GNU C compiler supports additional floating
types, <CODE>__float80</CODE> and <CODE>__float128</CODE> to support 80bit
(<CODE>XFmode</CODE>) and 128 bit (<CODE>TFmode</CODE>) floating types.
Support for additional types includes the arithmetic operators:
add, subtract, multiply, divide; unary arithmetic operators;
relational operators; equality operators; and conversions to and from
integer and other floating types.  Use a suffix <SAMP>`w'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`W'</SAMP>
in a literal constant of type <CODE>__float80</CODE> and <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`Q'</SAMP>
for <CODE>_float128</CODE>.  You can declare complex types using the
corresponding internal complex type, <CODE>XCmode</CODE> for <CODE>__float80</CODE>
type and <CODE>TCmode</CODE> for <CODE>__float128</CODE> type:

Not all targets support additional floating point types.  <CODE>__float80</CODE>
and <CODE>__float128</CODE> types are supported on i386, x86_64 and ia64 targets.
The <CODE>__float128</CODE> type is supported on hppa HP-UX targets.

<H2> 6.12 Half-Precision Floating Point </H2>
<!--docid::SEC66::-->
<P>

On ARM targets, GCC supports half-precision (16-bit) floating point via
the <CODE>__fp16</CODE> type.  You must enable this type explicitly
with the <SAMP>`-mfp16-format'</SAMP> command-line option in order to use it.
</P><P>

ARM supports two incompatible representations for half-precision
floating-point values.  You must choose one of the representations and
use it consistently in your program.
</P><P>

Specifying <SAMP>`-mfp16-format=ieee'</SAMP> selects the IEEE 754-2008 format.
This format can represent normalized values in the range of <EM>2^{-14</EM>} to 65504.
There are 11 bits of significand precision, approximately 3
decimal digits.
</P><P>

Specifying <SAMP>`-mfp16-format=alternative'</SAMP> selects the ARM
alternative format.  This representation is similar to the IEEE
format, but does not support infinities or NaNs.  Instead, the range
of exponents is extended, so that this format can represent normalized
values in the range of <EM>2^{-14</EM>} to 131008.
</P><P>

The <CODE>__fp16</CODE> type is a storage format only.  For purposes
of arithmetic and other operations, <CODE>__fp16</CODE> values in C or C++
expressions are automatically promoted to <CODE>float</CODE>.  In addition,
you cannot declare a function with a return value or parameters
of type <CODE>__fp16</CODE>.
</P><P>

Note that conversions from <CODE>double</CODE> to <CODE>__fp16</CODE>
involve an intermediate conversion to <CODE>float</CODE>.  Because
of rounding, this can sometimes produce a different result than a
direct conversion.
</P><P>

ARM provides hardware support for conversions between
<CODE>__fp16</CODE> and <CODE>float</CODE> values
as an extension to VFP and NEON (Advanced SIMD).  GCC generates
code using these hardware instructions if you compile with
options to select an FPU that provides them;
for example, <SAMP>`-mfpu=neon-fp16 -mfloat-abi=softfp'</SAMP>,
in addition to the <SAMP>`-mfp16-format'</SAMP> option to select
a half-precision format.
</P><P>

Language-level support for the <CODE>__fp16</CODE> data type is
independent of whether GCC generates code using hardware floating-point
instructions.  In cases where hardware support is not specified, GCC
implements conversions between <CODE>__fp16</CODE> and <CODE>float</CODE> values
as library calls.

<H2> 6.13 Decimal Floating Types </H2>
<!--docid::SEC67::-->
<P>

As an extension, the GNU C compiler supports decimal floating types as
defined in the N1312 draft of ISO/IEC WDTR24732.  Support for decimal
floating types in GCC will evolve as the draft technical report changes.
Calling conventions for any target might also change.  Not all targets
support decimal floating types.
</P><P>

The decimal floating types are <CODE>_Decimal32</CODE>, <CODE>_Decimal64</CODE>, and
<CODE>_Decimal128</CODE>.  They use a radix of ten, unlike the floating types
<CODE>float</CODE>, <CODE>double</CODE>, and <CODE>long double</CODE> whose radix is not
specified by the C standard but is usually two.
</P><P>

Support for decimal floating types includes the arithmetic operators
add, subtract, multiply, divide; unary arithmetic operators;
relational operators; equality operators; and conversions to and from
integer and other floating types.  Use a suffix <SAMP>`df'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`DF'</SAMP> in a literal constant of type <CODE>_Decimal32</CODE>, <SAMP>`dd'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`DD'</SAMP> for <CODE>_Decimal64</CODE>, and <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`DL'</SAMP> for
<CODE>_Decimal128</CODE>.
</P><P>

GCC support of decimal float as specified by the draft technical report
is incomplete:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
When the value of a decimal floating type cannot be represented in the
integer type to which it is being converted, the result is undefined
rather than the result value specified by the draft technical report.
<P>

<LI>
GCC does not provide the C library functionality associated with
<TT>`math.h'</TT>, <TT>`fenv.h'</TT>, <TT>`stdio.h'</TT>, <TT>`stdlib.h'</TT>, and
<TT>`wchar.h'</TT>, which must come from a separate C library implementation.
Because of this the GNU C compiler does not define macro
<CODE>__STDC_DEC_FP__</CODE> to indicate that the implementation conforms to
the technical report.
</UL>
<P>

Types <CODE>_Decimal32</CODE>, <CODE>_Decimal64</CODE>, and <CODE>_Decimal128</CODE>
are supported by the DWARF2 debug information format.

<H2> 6.14 Hex Floats </H2>
<!--docid::SEC68::-->
<P>

ISO C99 supports floating-point numbers written not only in the usual
decimal notation, such as <CODE>1.55e1</CODE>, but also numbers such as
<CODE>0x1.fp3</CODE> written in hexadecimal format.  As a GNU extension, GCC
supports this in C90 mode (except in some cases when strictly
conforming) and in C++.  In that format the
<SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> hex introducer and the <SAMP>`p'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`P'</SAMP> exponent field are
mandatory.  The exponent is a decimal number that indicates the power of
2 by which the significant part will be multiplied.  Thus <SAMP>`0x1.f'</SAMP> is
1 15/16,
<SAMP>`p3'</SAMP> multiplies it by 8, and the value of <CODE>0x1.fp3</CODE>
is the same as <CODE>1.55e1</CODE>.
</P><P>

Unlike for floating-point numbers in the decimal notation the exponent
is always required in the hexadecimal notation.  Otherwise the compiler
would not be able to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g., <CODE>0x1.f</CODE>.  This
could mean <CODE>1.0f</CODE> or <CODE>1.9375</CODE> since <SAMP>`f'</SAMP> is also the
extension for floating-point constants of type <CODE>float</CODE>.

<H2> 6.17 Arrays of Length Zero </H2>
<!--docid::SEC73::-->
<P>

Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as the
last element of a structure which is really a header for a variable-length
object:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct line {
  int length;
  char contents[0];
};

struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
  malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
thisline-&#62;length = this_length;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In ISO C90, you would have to give <CODE>contents</CODE> a length of 1, which
means either you waste space or complicate the argument to <CODE>malloc</CODE>.
</P><P>

In ISO C99, you would use a <EM>flexible array member</EM>, which is
slightly different in syntax and semantics:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Flexible array members are written as <CODE>contents[]</CODE> without
the <CODE>0</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the <CODE>sizeof</CODE>
operator may not be applied.  As a quirk of the original implementation
of zero-length arrays, <CODE>sizeof</CODE> evaluates to zero.
<P>

<LI>
Flexible array members may only appear as the last member of a
<CODE>struct</CODE> that is otherwise non-empty.
<P>

<LI>
A structure containing a flexible array member, or a union containing
such a structure (possibly recursively), may not be a member of a
structure or an element of an array.  (However, these uses are
permitted by GCC as extensions.)
</UL>
<P>

GCC versions before 3.0 allowed zero-length arrays to be statically
initialized, as if they were flexible arrays.  In addition to those
cases that were useful, it also allowed initializations in situations
that would corrupt later data.  Non-empty initialization of zero-length
arrays is now treated like any case where there are more initializer
elements than the array holds, in that a suitable warning about "excess
elements in array" is given, and the excess elements (all of them, in
this case) are ignored.
</P><P>

Instead GCC allows static initialization of flexible array members.
This is equivalent to defining a new structure containing the original
structure followed by an array of sufficient size to contain the data.
I.e. in the following, <CODE>f1</CODE> is constructed as if it were declared
like <CODE>f2</CODE>.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct f1 {
  int x; int y[];
} f1 = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };

struct f2 {
  struct f1 f1; int data[3];
} f2 = { { 1 }, { 2, 3, 4 } };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The convenience of this extension is that <CODE>f1</CODE> has the desired
type, eliminating the need to consistently refer to <CODE>f2.f1</CODE>.
</P><P>

This has symmetry with normal static arrays, in that an array of
unknown size is also written with <CODE>[]</CODE>.
</P><P>

Of course, this extension only makes sense if the extra data comes at
the end of a top-level object, as otherwise we would be overwriting
data at subsequent offsets.  To avoid undue complication and confusion
with initialization of deeply nested arrays, we simply disallow any
non-empty initialization except when the structure is the top-level
object.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct foo { int x; int y[]; };
struct bar { struct foo z; };

struct foo a = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };        // Valid.
struct bar b = { { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } } };    // Invalid.
struct bar c = { { 1, { } } };            // Valid.
struct foo d[1] = { { 1 { 2, 3, 4 } } };  // Invalid.

<H2> 6.19 Arrays of Variable Length </H2>
<!--docid::SEC75::-->
<P>

Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in ISO C99, and as an
extension GCC accepts them in C90 mode and in C++.  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>FILE *
concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
{
  char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
  strcpy (str, s1);
  strcat (str, s2);
  return fopen (str, mode);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1142"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1143"></A>
Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates the
storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1144"></A>
You can use the function <CODE>alloca</CODE> to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function <CODE>alloca</CODE> is available in
many other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.
</P><P>

There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with <CODE>alloca</CODE> exists until the containing <EM>function</EM> returns.
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array
name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
<CODE>alloca</CODE> in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with <CODE>alloca</CODE>.)
</P><P>

You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct entry
tester (int len, char data[len][len])
{
  /* <small>...</small> */
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
<CODE>sizeof</CODE>.
</P><P>

If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list--another GNU extension.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct entry
tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
{
  /* <small>...</small> */
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1145"></A>
The <SAMP>`int len'</SAMP> before the semicolon is a <EM>parameter forward
declaration</EM>, and it serves the purpose of making the name <CODE>len</CODE>
known when the declaration of <CODE>data</CODE> is parsed.
</P><P>

You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the "real"
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a "real"
declaration in parameter name and data type.  ISO C99 does not support
parameter forward declarations.

<H2> 6.20 Macros with a Variable Number of Arguments. </H2>
<!--docid::SEC76::-->
<P>

In the ISO C standard of 1999, a macro can be declared to accept a
variable number of arguments much as a function can.  The syntax for
defining the macro is similar to that of a function.  Here is an
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, __VA_ARGS__)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <SAMP>`<small>...</small>'</SAMP> is a <EM>variable argument</EM>.  In the invocation of
such a macro, it represents the zero or more tokens until the closing
parenthesis that ends the invocation, including any commas.  This set of
tokens replaces the identifier <CODE>__VA_ARGS__</CODE> in the macro body
wherever it appears.  See the CPP manual for more information.
</P><P>

GCC has long supported variadic macros, and used a different syntax that
allowed you to give a name to the variable arguments just like any other
argument.  Here is an example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define debug(format, args...) fprintf (stderr, format, args)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is in all ways equivalent to the ISO C example above, but arguably
more readable and descriptive.
</P><P>

GNU CPP has two further variadic macro extensions, and permits them to
be used with either of the above forms of macro definition.
</P><P>

In standard C, you are not allowed to leave the variable argument out
entirely; but you are allowed to pass an empty argument.  For example,
this invocation is invalid in ISO C, because there is no comma after
the string:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>debug ("A message")
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

GNU CPP permits you to completely omit the variable arguments in this
way.  In the above examples, the compiler would complain, though since
the expansion of the macro still has the extra comma after the format
string.
</P><P>

To help solve this problem, CPP behaves specially for variable arguments
used with the token paste operator, <SAMP>`##'</SAMP>.  If instead you write
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, ## __VA_ARGS__)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

and if the variable arguments are omitted or empty, the <SAMP>`##'</SAMP>
operator causes the preprocessor to remove the comma before it.  If you
do provide some variable arguments in your macro invocation, GNU CPP
does not complain about the paste operation and instead places the
variable arguments after the comma.  Just like any other pasted macro
argument, these arguments are not macro expanded.

<H2> 6.21 Slightly Looser Rules for Escaped Newlines </H2>
<!--docid::SEC77::-->
<P>

Recently, the preprocessor has relaxed its treatment of escaped
newlines.  Previously, the newline had to immediately follow a
backslash.  The current implementation allows whitespace in the form
of spaces, horizontal and vertical tabs, and form feeds between the
backslash and the subsequent newline.  The preprocessor issues a
warning, but treats it as a valid escaped newline and combines the two
lines to form a single logical line.  This works within comments and
tokens, as well as between tokens.  Comments are <EM>not</EM> treated as
whitespace for the purposes of this relaxation, since they have not
yet been replaced with spaces.

<H2> 6.25 Compound Literals </H2>
<!--docid::SEC81::-->
<P>

ISO C99 supports compound literals.  A compound literal looks like
a cast containing an initializer.  Its value is an object of the
type specified in the cast, containing the elements specified in
the initializer; it is an lvalue.  As an extension, GCC supports
compound literals in C90 mode and in C++.
</P><P>

Usually, the specified type is a structure.  Assume that
<CODE>struct foo</CODE> and <CODE>structure</CODE> are declared as shown:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here is an example of constructing a <CODE>struct foo</CODE> with a compound literal:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is equivalent to writing the following:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{
  struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
  structure = temp;
}

You can also construct an array.  If all the elements of the compound literal
are (made up of) simple constant expressions, suitable for use in
initializers of objects of static storage duration, then the compound
literal can be coerced to a pointer to its first element and used in
such an initializer, as shown here:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Compound literals for scalar types and union types are
also allowed, but then the compound literal is equivalent
to a cast.
</P><P>

As a GNU extension, GCC allows initialization of objects with static storage
duration by compound literals (which is not possible in ISO C99, because
the initializer is not a constant).
It is handled as if the object was initialized only with the bracket
enclosed list if the types of the compound literal and the object match.
The initializer list of the compound literal must be constant.
If the object being initialized has array type of unknown size, the size is
determined by compound literal size.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static struct foo x = (struct foo) {1, 'a', 'b'};
static int y[] = (int []) {1, 2, 3};
static int z[] = (int [3]) {1};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The above lines are equivalent to the following:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static struct foo x = {1, 'a', 'b'};
static int y[] = {1, 2, 3};
static int z[] = {1, 0, 0};

<H2> 6.26 Designated Initializers </H2>
<!--docid::SEC82::-->
<P>

Standard C90 requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a fixed
order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or structure
being initialized.
</P><P>

In ISO C99 you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
indices or structure field names they apply to, and GNU C allows this as
an extension in C90 mode as well.  This extension is not
implemented in GNU C++.
</P><P>

To specify an array index, write
<SAMP>`[<VAR>index</VAR>] ='</SAMP> before the element value.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int a[6] = { [4] = 29, [2] = 15 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
initialized is automatic.
</P><P>

An alternative syntax for this which has been obsolete since GCC 2.5 but
GCC still accepts is to write <SAMP>`[<VAR>index</VAR>]'</SAMP> before the element
value, with no <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.
</P><P>

To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write
<SAMP>`[<VAR>first</VAR> ... <VAR>last</VAR>] = <VAR>value</VAR>'</SAMP>.  This is a GNU
extension.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If the value in it has side-effects, the side-effects will happen only once,
not for each initialized field by the range initializer.
</P><P>

Note that the length of the array is the highest value specified
plus one.
</P><P>

In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
with <SAMP>`.<VAR>fieldname</VAR> ='</SAMP> before the element value.  For example,
given the following structure,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct point { int x, y; };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the following initialization
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Another syntax which has the same meaning, obsolete since GCC 2.5, is
<SAMP>`<VAR>fieldname</VAR>:'</SAMP>, as shown here:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1148"></A>
The <SAMP>`[<VAR>index</VAR>]'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`.<VAR>fieldname</VAR>'</SAMP> is known as a
<EM>designator</EM>.  You can also use a designator (or the obsolete colon
syntax) when initializing a union, to specify which element of the union
should be used.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>union foo { int i; double d; };

union foo f = { .d = 4 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will convert 4 to a <CODE>double</CODE> to store it in the union using
the second element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type <CODE>union foo</CODE>
would store it into the union as the integer <CODE>i</CODE>, since it is
an integer.  (See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC84">6.28 Cast to a Union Type</A>.)
</P><P>

You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
does not have a designator applies to the next consecutive element of the
array or structure.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful
when the indices are characters or belong to an <CODE>enum</CODE> type.
For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int whitespace[256]
  = { [' '] = 1, ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
      ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1149"></A>
You can also write a series of <SAMP>`.<VAR>fieldname</VAR>'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`[<VAR>index</VAR>]'</SAMP> designators before an <SAMP>`='</SAMP> to specify a
nested subobject to initialize; the list is taken relative to the
subobject corresponding to the closest surrounding brace pair.  For
example, with the <SAMP>`struct point'</SAMP> declaration above:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct point ptarray[10] = { [2].y = yv2, [2].x = xv2, [0].x = xv0 };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If the same field is initialized multiple times, it will have value from
the last initialization.  If any such overridden initialization has
side-effect, it is unspecified whether the side-effect happens or not.
Currently, GCC will discard them and issue a warning.

<H2> 6.28 Cast to a Union Type </H2>
<!--docid::SEC84::-->
<P>

A cast to union type is similar to other casts, except that the type
specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with
<CODE>union <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE> or with a typedef name.  A cast to union is actually
a constructor though, not a cast, and hence does not yield an lvalue like
normal casts.  (See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC81">6.25 Compound Literals</A>.)
</P><P>

The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>union foo { int i; double d; };
int x;
double y;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

both <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> can be cast to type <CODE>union foo</CODE>.
</P><P>

Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable of
union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>union foo u;
/* <small>...</small> */
u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You can also use the union cast as a function argument:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void hack (union foo);
/* <small>...</small> */
hack ((union foo) x);

ISO C99 and ISO C++ allow declarations and code to be freely mixed

C90 mode.  For example, you could do:

<H2> 6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC86::-->
<P>

In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your program
which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your code more
carefully.
</P><P>

The keyword <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> allows you to specify special
attributes when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an
attribute specification inside double parentheses.  The following
attributes are currently defined for functions on all targets:
<CODE>aligned</CODE>, <CODE>alloc_size</CODE>, <CODE>noreturn</CODE>,
<CODE>returns_twice</CODE>, <CODE>noinline</CODE>, <CODE>noclone</CODE>,
<CODE>always_inline</CODE>, <CODE>flatten</CODE>, <CODE>pure</CODE>, <CODE>const</CODE>,
<CODE>nothrow</CODE>, <CODE>sentinel</CODE>, <CODE>format</CODE>, <CODE>format_arg</CODE>,
<CODE>no_instrument_function</CODE>, <CODE>no_split_stack</CODE>,
<CODE>section</CODE>, <CODE>constructor</CODE>,
<CODE>destructor</CODE>, <CODE>used</CODE>, <CODE>unused</CODE>, <CODE>deprecated</CODE>,
<CODE>weak</CODE>, <CODE>malloc</CODE>, <CODE>alias</CODE>, <CODE>ifunc</CODE>,
<CODE>warn_unused_result</CODE>, <CODE>nonnull</CODE>, <CODE>gnu_inline</CODE>,
<CODE>externally_visible</CODE>, <CODE>hot</CODE>, <CODE>cold</CODE>, <CODE>artificial</CODE>,
<CODE>error</CODE> and <CODE>warning</CODE>.  Several other attributes are defined
for functions on particular target systems.  Other attributes,
including <CODE>section</CODE> are supported for variables declarations
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>) and for types (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC93">6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types</A>).
</P><P>

GCC plugins may provide their own attributes.
</P><P>

You may also specify attributes with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <CODE>__noreturn__</CODE> instead of <CODE>noreturn</CODE>.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC87">6.31 Attribute Syntax</A>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>alias ("<VAR>target</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1150"></A>
The <CODE>alias</CODE> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void __f () { /* Do something. */; }
void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

defines <SAMP>`f'</SAMP> to be a weak alias for <SAMP>`__f'</SAMP>.  In C++, the
mangled name for the target must be used.  It is an error if <SAMP>`__f'</SAMP>
is not defined in the same translation unit.
</P><P>

Not all target machines support this attribute.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1151"></A>
This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the function,
measured in bytes.
<P>

You cannot use this attribute to decrease the alignment of a function,
only to increase it.  However, when you explicitly specify a function
alignment this will override the effect of the
<SAMP>`-falign-functions'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC18">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</A>) option for this
function.
</P><P>

Note that the effectiveness of <CODE>aligned</CODE> attributes may be
limited by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the
linker is only able to arrange for functions to be aligned up to a
certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported
alignment may be very very small.)  See your linker documentation for
further information.
</P><P>

The <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute can also be used for variables and fields
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>.)
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>alloc_size</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1152"></A>
The <CODE>alloc_size</CODE> attribute is used to tell the compiler that the
function return value points to memory, where the size is given by
one or two of the functions parameters.  GCC uses this
information to improve the correctness of <CODE>__builtin_object_size</CODE>.
<P>

The function parameter(s) denoting the allocated size are specified by
one or two integer arguments supplied to the attribute.  The allocated size
is either the value of the single function argument specified or the product
of the two function arguments specified.  Argument numbering starts at
one.
</P><P>

For instance,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void* my_calloc(size_t, size_t) __attribute__((alloc_size(1,2)))
void my_realloc(void*, size_t) __attribute__((alloc_size(2)))
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

declares that my_calloc will return memory of the size given by
the product of parameter 1 and 2 and that my_realloc will return memory
of the size given by parameter 2.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>always_inline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1153"></A>
Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is specified.
For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines the function even
if no optimization level was specified.
<P>

<DT><CODE>gnu_inline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1154"></A>
This attribute should be used with a function which is also declared
with the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword.  It directs GCC to treat the function
as if it were defined in gnu90 mode even when compiling in C99 or
gnu99 mode.
<P>

If the function is declared <CODE>extern</CODE>, then this definition of the
function is used only for inlining.  In no case is the function
compiled as a standalone function, not even if you take its address
explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as if you
had only declared the function, and had not defined it.  This has
almost the effect of a macro.  The way to use this is to put a
function definition in a header file with this attribute, and put
another copy of the function, without <CODE>extern</CODE>, in a library
file.  The definition in the header file will cause most calls to the
function to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they will
refer to the single copy in the library.  Note that the two
definitions of the functions need not be precisely the same, although
if they do not have the same effect your program may behave oddly.
</P><P>

In C, if the function is neither <CODE>extern</CODE> nor <CODE>static</CODE>, then
the function is compiled as a standalone function, as well as being
inlined where possible.
</P><P>

This is how GCC traditionally handled functions declared
<CODE>inline</CODE>.  Since ISO C99 specifies a different semantics for
<CODE>inline</CODE>, this function attribute is provided as a transition
measure and as a useful feature in its own right.  This attribute is
available in GCC 4.1.3 and later.  It is available if either of the
preprocessor macros <CODE>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</CODE> or
<CODE>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</CODE> are defined.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC95">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</A>.
</P><P>

In C++, this attribute does not depend on <CODE>extern</CODE> in any way,
but it still requires the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword to enable its special
behavior.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>artificial</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1155"></A>
This attribute is useful for small inline wrappers which if possible
should appear during debugging as a unit, depending on the debug
info format it will either mean marking the function as artificial
or using the caller location for all instructions within the inlined
body.
<P>

<DT><CODE>bank_switch</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1156"></A>
When added to an interrupt handler with the M32C port, causes the
prologue and epilogue to use bank switching to preserve the registers
rather than saving them on the stack.
<P>

<DT><CODE>flatten</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1157"></A>
Generally, inlining into a function is limited.  For a function marked with
this attribute, every call inside this function will be inlined, if possible.
Whether the function itself is considered for inlining depends on its size and
the current inlining parameters.
<P>

<DT><CODE>error ("<VAR>message</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1158"></A>
If this attribute is used on a function declaration and a call to such a function
is not eliminated through dead code elimination or other optimizations, an error
which will include <VAR>message</VAR> will be diagnosed.  This is useful
for compile time checking, especially together with <CODE>__builtin_constant_p</CODE>
and inline functions where checking the inline function arguments is not
possible through <CODE>extern char [(condition) ? 1 : -1];</CODE> tricks.
While it is possible to leave the function undefined and thus invoke
a link failure, when using this attribute the problem will be diagnosed
earlier and with exact location of the call even in presence of inline
functions or when not emitting debugging information.
<P>

<DT><CODE>warning ("<VAR>message</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1159"></A>
If this attribute is used on a function declaration and a call to such a function
is not eliminated through dead code elimination or other optimizations, a warning
which will include <VAR>message</VAR> will be diagnosed.  This is useful
for compile time checking, especially together with <CODE>__builtin_constant_p</CODE>
and inline functions.  While it is possible to define the function with
a message in <CODE>.gnu.warning*</CODE> section, when using this attribute the problem
will be diagnosed earlier and with exact location of the call even in presence
of inline functions or when not emitting debugging information.
<P>

<DT><CODE>cdecl</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1161"></A>
On the Intel 386, the <CODE>cdecl</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the calling function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments.  This is
useful to override the effects of the <SAMP>`-mrtd'</SAMP> switch.
<P>

<DT><CODE>const</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1162"></A>
Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments, and
have no effects except the return value.  Basically this is just slightly
more strict class than the <CODE>pure</CODE> attribute below, since function is not
allowed to read global memory.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1163"></A>
Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
pointed to must <EM>not</EM> be declared <CODE>const</CODE>.  Likewise, a
function that calls a non-<CODE>const</CODE> function usually must not be
<CODE>const</CODE>.  It does not make sense for a <CODE>const</CODE> function to
return <CODE>void</CODE>.
</P><P>

The attribute <CODE>const</CODE> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no side
effects, which works in the current version and in some older versions,
is as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int intfn ();

extern const intfn square;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the language
specifies that the <SAMP>`const'</SAMP> must be attached to the return value.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>constructor</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>destructor</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>constructor (<VAR>priority</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>destructor (<VAR>priority</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1164"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1165"></A>
The <CODE>constructor</CODE> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically before execution enters <CODE>main ()</CODE>.  Similarly, the
<CODE>destructor</CODE> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically after <CODE>main ()</CODE> has completed or <CODE>exit ()</CODE> has
been called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
initializing data that will be used implicitly during the execution of
the program.
<P>

You may provide an optional integer priority to control the order in
which constructor and destructor functions are run.  A constructor
with a smaller priority number runs before a constructor with a larger
priority number; the opposite relationship holds for destructors.  So,
if you have a constructor that allocates a resource and a destructor
that deallocates the same resource, both functions typically have the
same priority.  The priorities for constructor and destructor
functions are the same as those specified for namespace-scope C++
objects (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC141">7.7 C++-Specific Variable, Function, and Type Attributes</A>).
</P><P>

These attributes are not currently implemented for Objective-C.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>deprecated</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>deprecated (<VAR>msg</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1166"></A>
The <CODE>deprecated</CODE> attribute results in a warning if the function
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
functions that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated function, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the function is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int old_fn () __attribute__ ((deprecated));
int old_fn ();
int (*fn_ptr)() = old_fn;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.  The optional msg
argument, which must be a string, will be printed in the warning if
present.
</P><P>

The <CODE>deprecated</CODE> attribute can also be used for variables and
types (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>, see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC93">6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types</A>.)
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>disinterrupt</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1167"></A>
On Epiphany and MeP targets, this attribute causes the compiler to emit
instructions to disable interrupts for the duration of the given
function.
<P>

<DT><CODE>dllexport</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1168"></A>
On Microsoft Windows targets and Symbian OS targets the
<CODE>dllexport</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to provide a global
pointer to a pointer in a DLL, so that it can be referenced with the
<CODE>dllimport</CODE> attribute.  On Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer
name is formed by combining <CODE>_imp__</CODE> and the function or variable
name.
<P>

You can use <CODE>__declspec(dllexport)</CODE> as a synonym for
<CODE>__attribute__ ((dllexport))</CODE> for compatibility with other
compilers.
</P><P>

On systems that support the <CODE>visibility</CODE> attribute, this
attribute also implies "default" visibility.  It is an error to
explicitly specify any other visibility.
</P><P>

In previous versions of GCC, the <CODE>dllexport</CODE> attribute was ignored
for inlined functions, unless the <SAMP>`-fkeep-inline-functions'</SAMP> flag
had been used.  The default behaviour now is to emit all dllexported
inline functions; however, this can cause object file-size bloat, in
which case the old behaviour can be restored by using
<SAMP>`-fno-keep-inline-dllexport'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

The attribute is also ignored for undefined symbols.
</P><P>

When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks defined non-inlined
member functions and static data members as exports.  Static consts
initialized in-class are not marked unless they are also defined
out-of-class.
</P><P>

For Microsoft Windows targets there are alternative methods for
including the symbol in the DLL's export table such as using a
<TT>`.def'</TT> file with an <CODE>EXPORTS</CODE> section or, with GNU ld, using
the <SAMP>`--export-all'</SAMP> linker flag.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>dllimport</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1169"></A>
On Microsoft Windows and Symbian OS targets, the <CODE>dllimport</CODE>
attribute causes the compiler to reference a function or variable via
a global pointer to a pointer that is set up by the DLL exporting the
symbol.  The attribute implies <CODE>extern</CODE>.  On Microsoft Windows
targets, the pointer name is formed by combining <CODE>_imp__</CODE> and the
function or variable name.
<P>

You can use <CODE>__declspec(dllimport)</CODE> as a synonym for
<CODE>__attribute__ ((dllimport))</CODE> for compatibility with other
compilers.
</P><P>

On systems that support the <CODE>visibility</CODE> attribute, this
attribute also implies "default" visibility.  It is an error to
explicitly specify any other visibility.
</P><P>

Currently, the attribute is ignored for inlined functions.  If the
attribute is applied to a symbol <EM>definition</EM>, an error is reported.
If a symbol previously declared <CODE>dllimport</CODE> is later defined, the
attribute is ignored in subsequent references, and a warning is emitted.
The attribute is also overridden by a subsequent declaration as
<CODE>dllexport</CODE>.
</P><P>

When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks non-inlined
member functions and static data members as imports.  However, the
attribute is ignored for virtual methods to allow creation of vtables
using thunks.
</P><P>

On the SH Symbian OS target the <CODE>dllimport</CODE> attribute also has
another affect--it can cause the vtable and run-time type information
for a class to be exported.  This happens when the class has a
dllimport'ed constructor or a non-inline, non-pure virtual function
and, for either of those two conditions, the class also has an inline
constructor or destructor and has a key function that is defined in
the current translation unit.
</P><P>

For Microsoft Windows based targets the use of the <CODE>dllimport</CODE>
attribute on functions is not necessary, but provides a small
performance benefit by eliminating a thunk in the DLL.  The use of the
<CODE>dllimport</CODE> attribute on imported variables was required on older
versions of the GNU linker, but can now be avoided by passing the
<SAMP>`--enable-auto-import'</SAMP> switch to the GNU linker.  As with
functions, using the attribute for a variable eliminates a thunk in
the DLL.
</P><P>

One drawback to using this attribute is that a pointer to a
<EM>variable</EM> marked as <CODE>dllimport</CODE> cannot be used as a constant
address. However, a pointer to a <EM>function</EM> with the
<CODE>dllimport</CODE> attribute can be used as a constant initializer; in
this case, the address of a stub function in the import lib is
referenced.  On Microsoft Windows targets, the attribute can be disabled
for functions by setting the <SAMP>`-mnop-fun-dllimport'</SAMP> flag.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>eightbit_data</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1170"></A>
Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the eight bit data section.
The compiler will generate more efficient code for certain operations
on data in the eight bit data area.  Note the eight bit data area is limited to
256 bytes of data.
<P>

The "<VAR>vector_address</VAR>" is the vector location in the range from 0 to 255.
</P><P>

Compiler uses 2 bytes instead of 4 bytes to call a function declared with this
attribute. For this compiler uses memory indirect call using jsr @aa:8 instruction.
</P><P>

For example, following call to "foo" will use 2 bytes instead of 4 bytes.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void foo (void) __attribute__ ((function_vector(vector_address)));
void foo (void)
{
}

void bar (void)
{
    foo();
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>exception_handler</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1171"></A>
Use this attribute on the Blackfin to indicate that the specified function
is an exception handler.  The compiler will generate function entry and
exit sequences suitable for use in an exception handler when this
attribute is present.
<P>

<DT><CODE>externally_visible</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1172"></A>
This attribute, attached to a global variable or function, nullifies
the effect of the <SAMP>`-fwhole-program'</SAMP> command-line option, so the
object remains visible outside the current compilation unit. If <SAMP>`-fwhole-program'</SAMP> is used together with <SAMP>`-flto'</SAMP> and <CODE>gold</CODE> is used as the linker plugin, <CODE>externally_visible</CODE> attributes are automatically added to functions (not variable yet due to a current <CODE>gold</CODE> issue) that are accessed outside of LTO objects according to resolution file produced by <CODE>gold</CODE>.  For other linkers that cannot generate resolution file, explicit <CODE>externally_visible</CODE> attributes are still necessary.
<P>

<DT><CODE>far</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1173"></A>
On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <CODE>far</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to
use a calling convention that takes care of switching memory banks when
entering and leaving a function.  This calling convention is also the
default when using the <SAMP>`-mlong-calls'</SAMP> option.
<P>

On 68HC12 the compiler will use the <CODE>call</CODE> and <CODE>rtc</CODE> instructions
to call and return from a function.
</P><P>

On 68HC11 the compiler will generate a sequence of instructions
to invoke a board-specific routine to switch the memory bank and call the
real function.  The board-specific routine simulates a <CODE>call</CODE>.
At the end of a function, it will jump to a board-specific routine
instead of using <CODE>rts</CODE>.  The board-specific return routine simulates
the <CODE>rtc</CODE>.
</P><P>

On MeP targets this causes the compiler to use a calling convention
which assumes the called function is too far away for the built-in
addressing modes.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>fast_interrupt</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1174"></A>
Use this attribute on the M32C and RX ports to indicate that the specified
function is a fast interrupt handler.  This is just like the
<CODE>interrupt</CODE> attribute, except that <CODE>freit</CODE> is used to return
instead of <CODE>reit</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>fastcall</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1175"></A>
On the Intel 386, the <CODE>fastcall</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to
pass the first argument (if of integral type) in the register ECX and
the second argument (if of integral type) in the register EDX.  Subsequent
and other typed arguments are passed on the stack.  The called function will
pop the arguments off the stack.  If the number of arguments is variable all
arguments are pushed on the stack.
<P>

<DT><CODE>thiscall</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1176"></A>
On the Intel 386, the <CODE>thiscall</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to
pass the first argument (if of integral type) in the register ECX.
Subsequent and other typed arguments are passed on the stack. The called
function will pop the arguments off the stack.
If the number of arguments is variable all arguments are pushed on the
stack.
The <CODE>thiscall</CODE> attribute is intended for C++ non-static member functions.
As gcc extension this calling convention can be used for C-functions
and for static member methods.
<P>

<DT><CODE>format (<VAR>archetype</VAR>, <VAR>string-index</VAR>, <VAR>first-to-check</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1177"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1178"></A>
The <CODE>format</CODE> attribute specifies that a function takes <CODE>printf</CODE>,
<CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE> or <CODE>strfmon</CODE> style arguments which
should be type-checked against a format string.  For example, the
declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern int
my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
      __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to <CODE>my_printf</CODE>
for consistency with the <CODE>printf</CODE> style format string argument
<CODE>my_format</CODE>.
</P><P>

The parameter <VAR>archetype</VAR> determines how the format string is
interpreted, and should be <CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE>,
<CODE>gnu_printf</CODE>, <CODE>gnu_scanf</CODE>, <CODE>gnu_strftime</CODE> or
<CODE>strfmon</CODE>.  (You can also use <CODE>__printf__</CODE>,
<CODE>__scanf__</CODE>, <CODE>__strftime__</CODE> or <CODE>__strfmon__</CODE>.)  On
MinGW targets, <CODE>ms_printf</CODE>, <CODE>ms_scanf</CODE>, and
<CODE>ms_strftime</CODE> are also present.
<VAR>archtype</VAR> values such as <CODE>printf</CODE> refer to the formats accepted
by the system's C run-time library, while <CODE>gnu_</CODE> values always refer
to the formats accepted by the GNU C Library.  On Microsoft Windows
targets, <CODE>ms_</CODE> values refer to the formats accepted by the
<TT>`msvcrt.dll'</TT> library.
The parameter <VAR>string-index</VAR>
specifies which argument is the format string argument (starting
from 1), while <VAR>first-to-check</VAR> is the number of the first
argument to check against the format string.  For functions
where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
<CODE>vprintf</CODE>), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
compiler only checks the format string for consistency.  For
<CODE>strftime</CODE> formats, the third parameter is required to be zero.
Since non-static C++ methods have an implicit <CODE>this</CODE> argument, the
arguments of such methods should be counted from two, not one, when
giving values for <VAR>string-index</VAR> and <VAR>first-to-check</VAR>.
</P><P>

In the example above, the format string (<CODE>my_format</CODE>) is the second
argument of the function <CODE>my_print</CODE>, and the arguments to check
start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
attribute are 2 and 3.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1179"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1180"></A>
The <CODE>format</CODE> attribute allows you to identify your own functions
which take format strings as arguments, so that GCC can check the
calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always (unless
<SAMP>`-ffreestanding'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-fno-builtin'</SAMP> is used) checks formats
for the standard library functions <CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>fprintf</CODE>,
<CODE>sprintf</CODE>, <CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>fscanf</CODE>, <CODE>sscanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE>,
<CODE>vprintf</CODE>, <CODE>vfprintf</CODE> and <CODE>vsprintf</CODE> whenever such
warnings are requested (using <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP>), so there is no need to
modify the header file <TT>`stdio.h'</TT>.  In C99 mode, the functions
<CODE>snprintf</CODE>, <CODE>vsnprintf</CODE>, <CODE>vscanf</CODE>, <CODE>vfscanf</CODE> and
<CODE>vsscanf</CODE> are also checked.  Except in strictly conforming C
standard modes, the X/Open function <CODE>strfmon</CODE> is also checked as
are <CODE>printf_unlocked</CODE> and <CODE>fprintf_unlocked</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC12">Options Controlling C Dialect</A>.
</P><P>

For Objective-C dialects, <CODE>NSString</CODE> (or <CODE>__NSString__</CODE>) is
recognized in the same context.  Declarations including these format attributes
will be parsed for correct syntax, however the result of checking of such format
strings is not yet defined, and will not be carried out by this version of the
compiler.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>format_arg (<VAR>string-index</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1181"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1182"></A>
The <CODE>format_arg</CODE> attribute specifies that a function takes a format
string for a <CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE> or
<CODE>strfmon</CODE> style function and modifies it (for example, to translate
it into another language), so the result can be passed to a
<CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE> or <CODE>strfmon</CODE> style
function (with the remaining arguments to the format function the same
as they would have been for the unmodified string).  For example, the
declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern char *
my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
      __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to a <CODE>printf</CODE>,
<CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE> or <CODE>strfmon</CODE> type function, whose
format string argument is a call to the <CODE>my_dgettext</CODE> function, for
consistency with the format string argument <CODE>my_format</CODE>.  If the
<CODE>format_arg</CODE> attribute had not been specified, all the compiler
could tell in such calls to format functions would be that the format
string argument is not constant; this would generate a warning when
<SAMP>`-Wformat-nonliteral'</SAMP> is used, but the calls could not be checked
without the attribute.
</P><P>

The parameter <VAR>string-index</VAR> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from one).  Since non-static C++ methods have
an implicit <CODE>this</CODE> argument, the arguments of such methods should
be counted from two.
</P><P>

The <CODE>format-arg</CODE> attribute allows you to identify your own
functions which modify format strings, so that GCC can check the
calls to <CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>strftime</CODE> or <CODE>strfmon</CODE>
type function whose operands are a call to one of your own function.
The compiler always treats <CODE>gettext</CODE>, <CODE>dgettext</CODE>, and
<CODE>dcgettext</CODE> in this manner except when strict ISO C support is
requested by <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> or an appropriate <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> option, or
<SAMP>`-ffreestanding'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-fno-builtin'</SAMP>
is used.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC12">Options Controlling C Dialect</A>.
</P><P>

For Objective-C dialects, the <CODE>format-arg</CODE> attribute may refer to an
<CODE>NSString</CODE> reference for compatibility with the <CODE>format</CODE> attribute
above.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>function_vector (<VAR>vector_address</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1183"></A>
Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that the specified
function should be called through the function vector.  Calling a
function through the function vector will reduce code size, however;
the function vector has a limited size (maximum 128 entries on the H8/300
and 64 entries on the H8/300H and H8S) and shares space with the interrupt vector.
<P>

In SH2A target, this attribute declares a function to be called using the
TBR relative addressing mode.  The argument to this attribute is the entry
number of the same function in a vector table containing all the TBR
relative addressable functions.  For the successful jump, register TBR
should contain the start address of this TBR relative vector table.
In the startup routine of the user application, user needs to care of this
TBR register initialization.  The TBR relative vector table can have at
max 256 function entries.  The jumps to these functions will be generated
using a SH2A specific, non delayed branch instruction JSR/N @(disp8,TBR).
You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.
</P><P>

Please refer the example of M16C target, to see the use of this
attribute while declaring a function,
</P><P>

In an application, for a function being called once, this attribute will
save at least 8 bytes of code; and if other successive calls are being
made to the same function, it will save 2 bytes of code per each of these
calls.
</P><P>

On M16C/M32C targets, the <CODE>function_vector</CODE> attribute declares a
special page subroutine call function. Use of this attribute reduces
the code size by 2 bytes for each call generated to the
subroutine. The argument to the attribute is the vector number entry
from the special page vector table which contains the 16 low-order
bits of the subroutine's entry address. Each vector table has special
page number (18 to 255) which are used in <CODE>jsrs</CODE> instruction.
Jump addresses of the routines are generated by adding 0x0F0000 (in
case of M16C targets) or 0xFF0000 (in case of M32C targets), to the 2
byte addresses set in the vector table. Therefore you need to ensure
that all the special page vector routines should get mapped within the
address range 0x0F0000 to 0x0FFFFF (for M16C) and 0xFF0000 to 0xFFFFFF
(for M32C).
</P><P>

In the following example 2 bytes will be saved for each call to
function <CODE>foo</CODE>.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void foo (void) __attribute__((function_vector(0x18)));
void foo (void)
{
}

void bar (void)
{
    foo();
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If functions are defined in one file and are called in another file,
then be sure to write this declaration in both files.
</P><P>

This attribute is ignored for R8C target.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>interrupt</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1184"></A>
Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, CR16, Epiphany, M32C, M32R/D, m68k, MeP, MIPS,
RL78, RX and Xstormy16 ports to indicate that the specified function is an
interrupt handler.  The compiler will generate function entry and exit
sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler when this attribute
is present.  With Epiphany targets it may also generate a special section with
code to initialize the interrupt vector table.
<P>

Note, interrupt handlers for the Blackfin, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S, MicroBlaze,
and SH processors can be specified via the <CODE>interrupt_handler</CODE> attribute.
</P><P>

Note, on the AVR, interrupts will be enabled inside the function.
</P><P>

Note, for the ARM, you can specify the kind of interrupt to be handled by
adding an optional parameter to the interrupt attribute like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("IRQ")));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Permissible values for this parameter are: IRQ, FIQ, SWI, ABORT and UNDEF.
</P><P>

On ARMv7-M the interrupt type is ignored, and the attribute means the function
may be called with a word aligned stack pointer.
</P><P>

On Epiphany targets one or more optional parameters can be added like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"))) universal_dma_handler ();
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Permissible values for these parameters are: <CODE>reset</CODE>,
<CODE>software_exception</CODE>, <CODE>page_miss</CODE>,
<CODE>timer0</CODE>, <CODE>timer1</CODE>, <CODE>message</CODE>,
<CODE>dma0</CODE>, <CODE>dma1</CODE>, <CODE>wand</CODE> and <CODE>swi</CODE>.
Multiple parameters indicate that multiple entries in the interrupt
vector table should be initialized for this function, i.e. for each
parameter <VAR>name</VAR>, a jump to the function will be emitted in
the section ivt_entry_<VAR>name</VAR>.  The parameter(s) may be omitted
entirely, in which case no interrupt vector table entry will be provided.
</P><P>

Note, on Epiphany targets, interrupts are enabled inside the function
unless the <CODE>disinterrupt</CODE> attribute is also specified.
</P><P>

On Epiphany targets, you can also use the following attribute to
modify the behavior of an interrupt handler:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>forwarder_section</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1185"></A>
The interrupt handler may be in external memory which cannot be
reached by a branch instruction, so generate a local memory trampoline
to transfer control.  The single parameter identifies the section where
the trampoline will be placed.
</DL>
<P>

The following examples are all valid uses of these attributes on
Epiphany targets:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void __attribute__ ((interrupt)) universal_handler ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma1"))) dma1_handler ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"))) universal_dma_handler ();

  fast_timer_handler ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"), forwarder_section ("tramp")))
  external_dma_handler ();

On MIPS targets, you can use the following attributes to modify the behavior
of an interrupt handler:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>use_shadow_register_set</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1186"></A>
Assume that the handler uses a shadow register set, instead of
the main general-purpose registers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>keep_interrupts_masked</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1187"></A>
Keep interrupts masked for the whole function.  Without this attribute,
GCC tries to reenable interrupts for as much of the function as it can.
<P>

<DT><CODE>use_debug_exception_return</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1188"></A>
Return using the <CODE>deret</CODE> instruction.  Interrupt handlers that don't
have this attribute return using <CODE>eret</CODE> instead.
</DL>
<P>

You can use any combination of these attributes, as shown below:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void __attribute__ ((interrupt)) v0 ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_shadow_register_set)) v1 ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt, keep_interrupts_masked)) v2 ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_debug_exception_return)) v3 ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_shadow_register_set,
                     keep_interrupts_masked)) v4 ();
void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_shadow_register_set,

                     use_debug_exception_return)) v7 ();
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

On RL78, use <CODE>brk_interrupt</CODE> instead of <CODE>interrupt</CODE> for
handlers intended to be used with the <CODE>BRK</CODE> opcode (i.e.  those
that must end with <CODE>RETB</CODE> instead of <CODE>RETI</CODE>).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>ifunc ("<VAR>resolver</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1189"></A>
The <CODE>ifunc</CODE> attribute is used to mark a function as an indirect
function using the STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol type extension to the ELF
standard.  This allows the resolution of the symbol value to be
determined dynamically at load time, and an optimized version of the
routine can be selected for the particular processor or other system
characteristics determined then.  To use this attribute, first define
the implementation functions available, and a resolver function that
returns a pointer to the selected implementation function.  The
implementation functions' declarations must match the API of the
function being implemented, the resolver's declaration is be a
function returning pointer to void function returning void:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void *my_memcpy (void *dst, const void *src, size_t len)
{
  <small>...</small>
}

static void (*resolve_memcpy (void)) (void)
{
  return my_memcpy; // we'll just always select this routine
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The exported header file declaring the function the user calls would
contain:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

allowing the user to call this as a regular function, unaware of the
implementation.  Finally, the indirect function needs to be defined in
the same translation unit as the resolver function:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t)
     __attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_memcpy")));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Indirect functions cannot be weak, and require a recent binutils (at
least version 2.20.1), and GNU C library (at least version 2.11.1).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>interrupt_handler</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1190"></A>
Use this attribute on the Blackfin, m68k, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S, and SH to
indicate that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler
will generate function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an
interrupt handler when this attribute is present.
<P>

<DT><CODE>interrupt_thread</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1191"></A>
Use this attribute on fido, a subarchitecture of the m68k, to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler that is designed
to run as a thread.  The compiler omits generate prologue/epilogue
sequences and replaces the return instruction with a <CODE>sleep</CODE>
instruction.  This attribute is available only on fido.
<P>

<DT><CODE>isr</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1192"></A>
Use this attribute on ARM to write Interrupt Service Routines. This is an
alias to the <CODE>interrupt</CODE> attribute above.
<P>

<DT><CODE>kspisusp</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1193"></A>
When used together with <CODE>interrupt_handler</CODE>, <CODE>exception_handler</CODE>
or <CODE>nmi_handler</CODE>, code will be generated to load the stack pointer
from the USP register in the function prologue.
<P>

<DT><CODE>l1_text</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1194"></A>
This attribute specifies a function to be placed into L1 Instruction
SRAM. The function will be put into a specific section named <CODE>.l1.text</CODE>.
With <SAMP>`-mfdpic'</SAMP>, function calls with a such function as the callee
or caller will use inlined PLT.
<P>

<DT><CODE>l2</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1195"></A>
On the Blackfin, this attribute specifies a function to be placed into L2
SRAM. The function will be put into a specific section named
<CODE>.l1.text</CODE>. With <SAMP>`-mfdpic'</SAMP>, callers of such functions will use
an inlined PLT.
<P>

<DT><CODE>leaf</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1196"></A>
Calls to external functions with this attribute must return to the current
compilation unit only by return or by exception handling.  In particular, leaf
functions are not allowed to call callback function passed to it from the current
compilation unit or directly call functions exported by the unit or longjmp
into the unit.  Leaf function might still call functions from other compilation
units and thus they are not necessarily leaf in the sense that they contain no
function calls at all.
<P>

The attribute is intended for library functions to improve dataflow analysis.
The compiler takes the hint that any data not escaping the current compilation unit can
not be used or modified by the leaf function.  For example, the <CODE>sin</CODE> function
is a leaf function, but <CODE>qsort</CODE> is not.
</P><P>

Note that leaf functions might invoke signals and signal handlers might be
defined in the current compilation unit and use static variables.  The only
compliant way to write such a signal handler is to declare such variables
<CODE>volatile</CODE>.
</P><P>

The attribute has no effect on functions defined within the current compilation
unit.  This is to allow easy merging of multiple compilation units into one,
for example, by using the link time optimization.  For this reason the
attribute is not allowed on types to annotate indirect calls.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>malloc</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1197"></A>
The <CODE>malloc</CODE> attribute is used to tell the compiler that a function
may be treated as if any non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer it returns cannot
alias any other pointer valid when the function returns and that the memory
has undefined content.
This will often improve optimization.
Standard functions with this property include <CODE>malloc</CODE> and
<CODE>calloc</CODE>.  <CODE>realloc</CODE>-like functions do not have this
property as the memory pointed to does not have undefined content.
<P>

<DT><CODE>naked</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1198"></A>
Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, MCORE, RX and SPU ports to indicate that
the specified function does not need prologue/epilogue sequences generated by
the compiler.  It is up to the programmer to provide these sequences. The
only statements that can be safely included in naked functions are
<CODE>asm</CODE> statements that do not have operands.  All other statements,
including declarations of local variables, <CODE>if</CODE> statements, and so
forth, should be avoided.  Naked functions should be used to implement the
body of an assembly function, while allowing the compiler to construct
the requisite function declaration for the assembler.
<P>

<DT><CODE>near</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1199"></A>
On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <CODE>near</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to
use the normal calling convention based on <CODE>jsr</CODE> and <CODE>rts</CODE>.
This attribute can be used to cancel the effect of the <SAMP>`-mlong-calls'</SAMP>
option.
<P>

On MeP targets this attribute causes the compiler to assume the called
function is close enough to use the normal calling convention,
overriding the <CODE>-mtf</CODE> command line option.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>nesting</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1200"></A>
Use this attribute together with <CODE>interrupt_handler</CODE>,
<CODE>exception_handler</CODE> or <CODE>nmi_handler</CODE> to indicate that the function
entry code should enable nested interrupts or exceptions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>nmi_handler</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1201"></A>
Use this attribute on the Blackfin to indicate that the specified function
is an NMI handler.  The compiler will generate function entry and
exit sequences suitable for use in an NMI handler when this
attribute is present.
<P>

<DT><CODE>no_instrument_function</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1202"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1203"></A>
If <SAMP>`-finstrument-functions'</SAMP> is given, profiling function calls will
be generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions.
Functions with this attribute will not be so instrumented.
<P>

<DT><CODE>no_split_stack</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1204"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1205"></A>
If <SAMP>`-fsplit-stack'</SAMP> is given, functions will have a small
prologue which decides whether to split the stack.  Functions with the
<CODE>no_split_stack</CODE> attribute will not have that prologue, and thus
may run with only a small amount of stack space available.
<P>

<DT><CODE>noinline</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1206"></A>
This function attribute prevents a function from being considered for
inlining.
If the function does not have side-effects, there are optimizations
other than inlining that causes function calls to be optimized away,
although the function call is live.  To keep such calls from being
optimized away, put
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("");
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table>(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC97">6.41 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</A>) in the called function, to serve as a special
side-effect.
<P>

<DT><CODE>noclone</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1207"></A>
This function attribute prevents a function from being considered for
cloning - a mechanism which produces specialized copies of functions
and which is (currently) performed by interprocedural constant
propagation.
<P>

<DT><CODE>nonnull (<VAR>arg-index</VAR>, <small>...</small>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1208"></A>
The <CODE>nonnull</CODE> attribute specifies that some function parameters should
be non-null pointers.  For instance, the declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern void *
my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
        __attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

causes the compiler to check that, in calls to <CODE>my_memcpy</CODE>,
arguments <VAR>dest</VAR> and <VAR>src</VAR> are non-null.  If the compiler
determines that a null pointer is passed in an argument slot marked
as non-null, and the <SAMP>`-Wnonnull'</SAMP> option is enabled, a warning
is issued.  The compiler may also choose to make optimizations based
on the knowledge that certain function arguments will not be null.
</P><P>

If no argument index list is given to the <CODE>nonnull</CODE> attribute,
all pointer arguments are marked as non-null.  To illustrate, the
following declaration is equivalent to the previous example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern void *
my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
        __attribute__((nonnull));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>noreturn</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1209"></A>
A few standard library functions, such as <CODE>abort</CODE> and <CODE>exit</CODE>,
cannot return.  GCC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
<CODE>noreturn</CODE> to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));

void
fatal (/* <small>...</small> */)
{
  /* <small>...</small> */ /* Print error message. */ /* <small>...</small> */
  exit (1);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>noreturn</CODE> keyword tells the compiler to assume that
<CODE>fatal</CODE> cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what
would happen if <CODE>fatal</CODE> ever did return.  This makes slightly
better code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
uninitialized variables.
</P><P>

The <CODE>noreturn</CODE> keyword does not affect the exceptional path when that
applies: a <CODE>noreturn</CODE>-marked function may still return to the caller
by throwing an exception or calling <CODE>longjmp</CODE>.
</P><P>

Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
restored before calling the <CODE>noreturn</CODE> function.
</P><P>

It does not make sense for a <CODE>noreturn</CODE> function to have a return
type other than <CODE>void</CODE>.
</P><P>

The attribute <CODE>noreturn</CODE> is not implemented in GCC versions
earlier than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function does
not return, which works in the current version and in some older
versions, is as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef void voidfn ();

volatile voidfn fatal;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This approach does not work in GNU C++.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>nothrow</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1210"></A>
The <CODE>nothrow</CODE> attribute is used to inform the compiler that a
function cannot throw an exception.  For example, most functions in
the standard C library can be guaranteed not to throw an exception
with the notable exceptions of <CODE>qsort</CODE> and <CODE>bsearch</CODE> that
take function pointer arguments.  The <CODE>nothrow</CODE> attribute is not
implemented in GCC versions earlier than 3.3.
<P>

<DT><CODE>optimize</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1211"></A>
The <CODE>optimize</CODE> attribute is used to specify that a function is to
be compiled with different optimization options than specified on the
command line.  Arguments can either be numbers or strings.  Numbers
are assumed to be an optimization level.  Strings that begin with
<CODE>O</CODE> are assumed to be an optimization option, while other options
are assumed to be used with a <CODE>-f</CODE> prefix.  You can also use the
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC optimize'</SAMP> pragma to set the optimization options
that affect more than one function.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC128">6.56.8 Function Specific Option Pragmas</A>, for details about the
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC optimize'</SAMP> pragma.
<P>

This can be used for instance to have frequently executed functions
compiled with more aggressive optimization options that produce faster
and larger code, while other functions can be called with less
aggressive options.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>OS_main/OS_task</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1212"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1213"></A>
On AVR, functions with the <CODE>OS_main</CODE> or <CODE>OS_task</CODE> attribute
do not save/restore any call-saved register in their prologue/epilogue.
<P>

The <CODE>OS_main</CODE> attribute can be used when there <EM>is
guarantee</EM> that interrupts are disabled at the time when the function
is entered.  This will save resources when the stack pointer has to be
changed to set up a frame for local variables.
</P><P>

The <CODE>OS_task</CODE> attribute can be used when there is <EM>no
guarantee</EM> that interrupts are disabled at that time when the function
is entered like for, e.g. task functions in a multi-threading operating
system. In that case, changing the stack pointer register will be
guarded by save/clear/restore of the global interrupt enable flag.
</P><P>

The differences to the <CODE>naked</CODE> function attribute are:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>naked</CODE> functions do not have a return instruction whereas
<CODE>OS_main</CODE> and <CODE>OS_task</CODE> functions will have a <CODE>RET</CODE> or
<CODE>RETI</CODE> return instruction.
<LI><CODE>naked</CODE> functions do not set up a frame for local variables
or a frame pointer whereas <CODE>OS_main</CODE> and <CODE>OS_task</CODE> do this
as needed.
</UL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>pcs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1214"></A>
<P>

The <CODE>pcs</CODE> attribute can be used to control the calling convention
used for a function on ARM.  The attribute takes an argument that specifies
the calling convention to use.
</P><P>

When compiling using the AAPCS ABI (or a variant of that) then valid
values for the argument are <CODE>"aapcs"</CODE> and <CODE>"aapcs-vfp"</CODE>.  In
order to use a variant other than <CODE>"aapcs"</CODE> then the compiler must
be permitted to use the appropriate co-processor registers (i.e., the
VFP registers must be available in order to use <CODE>"aapcs-vfp"</CODE>).
For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>/* Argument passed in r0, and result returned in r0+r1.  */
double f2d (float) __attribute__((pcs("aapcs")));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Variadic functions always use the <CODE>"aapcs"</CODE> calling convention and
the compiler will reject attempts to specify an alternative.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>pure</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1215"></A>
Many functions have no effects except the return value and their
return value depends only on the parameters and/or global variables.
Such a function can be subject
to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an
arithmetic operator would be.  These functions should be declared
with the attribute <CODE>pure</CODE>.  For example,
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int square (int) __attribute__ ((pure));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

says that the hypothetical function <CODE>square</CODE> is safe to call
fewer times than the program says.
</P><P>

Some of common examples of pure functions are <CODE>strlen</CODE> or <CODE>memcmp</CODE>.
Interesting non-pure functions are functions with infinite loops or those
depending on volatile memory or other system resource, that may change between
two consecutive calls (such as <CODE>feof</CODE> in a multithreading environment).
</P><P>

The attribute <CODE>pure</CODE> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.96.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>hot</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1216"></A>
The <CODE>hot</CODE> attribute is used to inform the compiler that a function is a
hot spot of the compiled program.  The function is optimized more aggressively
and on many target it is placed into special subsection of the text section so
all hot functions appears close together improving locality.
<P>

When profile feedback is available, via <SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP>, hot functions
are automatically detected and this attribute is ignored.
</P><P>

The <CODE>hot</CODE> attribute is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 4.3.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>cold</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1217"></A>
The <CODE>cold</CODE> attribute is used to inform the compiler that a function is
unlikely executed.  The function is optimized for size rather than speed and on
many targets it is placed into special subsection of the text section so all
cold functions appears close together improving code locality of non-cold parts
of program.  The paths leading to call of cold functions within code are marked
as unlikely by the branch prediction mechanism. It is thus useful to mark
functions used to handle unlikely conditions, such as <CODE>perror</CODE>, as cold to
improve optimization of hot functions that do call marked functions in rare
occasions.
<P>

When profile feedback is available, via <SAMP>`-fprofile-use'</SAMP>, hot functions
are automatically detected and this attribute is ignored.
</P><P>

The <CODE>cold</CODE> attribute is not implemented in GCC versions earlier than 4.3.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>regparm (<VAR>number</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1218"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1219"></A>
On the Intel 386, the <CODE>regparm</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to
pass arguments number one to <VAR>number</VAR> if they are of integral type
in registers EAX, EDX, and ECX instead of on the stack.  Functions that
take a variable number of arguments will continue to be passed all of their
arguments on the stack.
<P>

Beware that on some ELF systems this attribute is unsuitable for
global functions in shared libraries with lazy binding (which is the
default).  Lazy binding will send the first call via resolving code in
the loader, which might assume EAX, EDX and ECX can be clobbered, as
per the standard calling conventions.  Solaris 8 is affected by this.
GNU systems with GLIBC 2.1 or higher, and FreeBSD, are believed to be
safe since the loaders there save EAX, EDX and ECX.  (Lazy binding can be
disabled with the linker or the loader if desired, to avoid the
problem.)
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>sseregparm</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1220"></A>
On the Intel 386 with SSE support, the <CODE>sseregparm</CODE> attribute
causes the compiler to pass up to 3 floating point arguments in
SSE registers instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a
variable number of arguments will continue to pass all of their
floating point arguments on the stack.
<P>

<DT><CODE>force_align_arg_pointer</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1221"></A>
On the Intel x86, the <CODE>force_align_arg_pointer</CODE> attribute may be
applied to individual function definitions, generating an alternate
prologue and epilogue that realigns the runtime stack if necessary.
This supports mixing legacy codes that run with a 4-byte aligned stack
with modern codes that keep a 16-byte stack for SSE compatibility.
<P>

<DT><CODE>resbank</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1222"></A>
On the SH2A target, this attribute enables the high-speed register
saving and restoration using a register bank for <CODE>interrupt_handler</CODE>
routines.  Saving to the bank is performed automatically after the CPU
accepts an interrupt that uses a register bank.
<P>

The nineteen 32-bit registers comprising general register R0 to R14,
control register GBR, and system registers MACH, MACL, and PR and the
vector table address offset are saved into a register bank.  Register
banks are stacked in first-in last-out (FILO) sequence.  Restoration
from the bank is executed by issuing a RESBANK instruction.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>returns_twice</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1223"></A>
The <CODE>returns_twice</CODE> attribute tells the compiler that a function may
return more than one time.  The compiler will ensure that all registers
are dead before calling such a function and will emit a warning about
the variables that may be clobbered after the second return from the
function.  Examples of such functions are <CODE>setjmp</CODE> and <CODE>vfork</CODE>.
The <CODE>longjmp</CODE>-like counterpart of such function, if any, might need
to be marked with the <CODE>noreturn</CODE> attribute.
<P>

<DT><CODE>saveall</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1224"></A>
Use this attribute on the Blackfin, H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that
all registers except the stack pointer should be saved in the prologue
regardless of whether they are used or not.
<P>

<DT><CODE>save_volatiles</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1225"></A>
Use this attribute on the MicroBlaze to indicate that the function is
an interrupt handler.  All volatile registers (in addition to non-volatile
registers) will be saved in the function prologue.  If the function is a leaf
function, only volatiles used by the function are saved.  A normal function
return is generated instead of a return from interrupt.
<P>

<DT><CODE>section ("<VAR>section-name</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1226"></A>
Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the <CODE>text</CODE> section.
Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you need certain
particular functions to appear in special sections.  The <CODE>section</CODE>
attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular section.
For example, the declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

puts the function <CODE>foobar</CODE> in the <CODE>bar</CODE> section.
</P><P>

Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <CODE>section</CODE>
attribute is not available on all platforms.
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>sentinel</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1227"></A>
This function attribute ensures that a parameter in a function call is
an explicit <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  The attribute is only valid on variadic
functions.  By default, the sentinel is located at position zero, the
last parameter of the function call.  If an optional integer position
argument P is supplied to the attribute, the sentinel must be located at
position P counting backwards from the end of the argument list.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>__attribute__ ((sentinel))
is equivalent to
__attribute__ ((sentinel(0)))
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The attribute is automatically set with a position of 0 for the built-in
functions <CODE>execl</CODE> and <CODE>execlp</CODE>.  The built-in function
<CODE>execle</CODE> has the attribute set with a position of 1.
</P><P>

A valid <CODE>NULL</CODE> in this context is defined as zero with any pointer
type.  If your system defines the <CODE>NULL</CODE> macro with an integer type
then you need to add an explicit cast.  GCC replaces <CODE>stddef.h</CODE>
with a copy that redefines NULL appropriately.

<DT><CODE>signal</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1228"></A>
Use this attribute on the AVR to indicate that the specified
function is a signal handler.  The compiler will generate function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in a signal handler when this
attribute is present.  Interrupts will be disabled inside the function.
<P>

<DT><CODE>sp_switch</CODE>
<DD>Use this attribute on the SH to indicate an <CODE>interrupt_handler</CODE>
function should switch to an alternate stack.  It expects a string
argument that names a global variable holding the address of the
alternate stack.

<DT><CODE>stdcall</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1229"></A>
On the Intel 386, the <CODE>stdcall</CODE> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the called function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments, unless it takes a variable number of arguments.
<P>

<DT><CODE>syscall_linkage</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1230"></A>
This attribute is used to modify the IA64 calling convention by marking
all input registers as live at all function exits.  This makes it possible
to restart a system call after an interrupt without having to save/restore
the input registers.  This also prevents kernel data from leaking into
application code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>target</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1231"></A>
The <CODE>target</CODE> attribute is used to specify that a function is to
be compiled with different target options than specified on the
command line.  This can be used for instance to have functions
compiled with a different ISA (instruction set architecture) than the
default.  You can also use the <SAMP>`#pragma GCC target'</SAMP> pragma to set
more than one function to be compiled with specific target options.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC128">6.56.8 Function Specific Option Pragmas</A>, for details about the
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC target'</SAMP> pragma.
<P>

For instance on a 386, you could compile one function with
<CODE>target("sse4.1,arch=core2")</CODE> and another with
<CODE>target("sse4a,arch=amdfam10")</CODE> that would be equivalent to
compiling the first function with <SAMP>`-msse4.1'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-march=core2'</SAMP> options, and the second function with
<SAMP>`-msse4a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-march=amdfam10'</SAMP> options.  It is up to the
user to make sure that a function is only invoked on a machine that
supports the particular ISA it was compiled for (for example by using
<CODE>cpuid</CODE> on 386 to determine what feature bits and architecture
family are used).

<DT><CODE>used</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1261"></A>
This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be emitted

This is useful, for example, when the function is referenced only in
inline assembly.

When applied to a member function of a C++ class template, the

hidden, protected or internal visibility.

The possible values of <VAR>visibility_type</VAR> correspond to the
visibility settings in the ELF gABI.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>default</EM>
<DD>Default visibility is the normal case for the object file format.
This value is available for the visibility attribute to override other
options that may change the assumed visibility of entities.
<P>

On ELF, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to other
modules and, in shared libraries, means that the declared entity may be
overridden.
</P><P>

On Darwin, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to
other modules.
</P><P>

Default visibility corresponds to "external linkage" in the language.
</P><P>

<DT><EM>hidden</EM>
<DD>Hidden visibility indicates that the entity declared will have a new
form of linkage, which we'll call "hidden linkage".  Two
declarations of an object with hidden linkage refer to the same object
if they are in the same shared object.
<P>

<DT><EM>internal</EM>
<DD>Internal visibility is like hidden visibility, but with additional
processor specific semantics.  Unless otherwise specified by the
psABI, GCC defines internal visibility to mean that a function is
<EM>never</EM> called from another module.  Compare this with hidden
functions which, while they cannot be referenced directly by other
modules, can be referenced indirectly via function pointers.  By
indicating that a function cannot be called from outside the module,
GCC may for instance omit the load of a PIC register since it is known
that the calling function loaded the correct value.
<P>

<DT><EM>protected</EM>
<DD>Protected visibility is like default visibility except that it
indicates that references within the defining module will bind to the
definition in that module.  That is, the declared entity cannot be
overridden by another module.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

All visibilities are supported on many, but not all, ELF targets
(supported when the assembler supports the <SAMP>`.visibility'</SAMP>
pseudo-op).  Default visibility is supported everywhere.  Hidden
visibility is supported on Darwin targets.
</P><P>

The visibility attribute should be applied only to declarations which
would otherwise have external linkage.  The attribute should be applied
consistently, so that the same entity should not be declared with
different settings of the attribute.
</P><P>

In C++, the visibility attribute applies to types as well as functions
and objects, because in C++ types have linkage.  A class must not have
greater visibility than its non-static data member types and bases,
and class members default to the visibility of their class.  Also, a
declaration without explicit visibility is limited to the visibility
of its type.
</P><P>

In C++, you can mark member functions and static member variables of a
class with the visibility attribute.  This is useful if you know a
particular method or static member variable should only be used from
one shared object; then you can mark it hidden while the rest of the
class has default visibility.  Care must be taken to avoid breaking
the One Definition Rule; for example, it is usually not useful to mark
an inline method as hidden without marking the whole class as hidden.
</P><P>

A C++ namespace declaration can also have the visibility attribute.
This attribute applies only to the particular namespace body, not to
other definitions of the same namespace; it is equivalent to using
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC visibility'</SAMP> before and after the namespace
definition (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC126">6.56.6 Visibility Pragmas</A>).
</P><P>

In C++, if a template argument has limited visibility, this
restriction is implicitly propagated to the template instantiation.
Otherwise, template instantiations and specializations default to the
visibility of their template.
</P><P>

If both the template and enclosing class have explicit visibility, the
visibility from the template is used.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>vliw</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1264"></A>
On MeP, the <CODE>vliw</CODE> attribute tells the compiler to emit
instructions in VLIW mode instead of core mode.  Note that this
attribute is not allowed unless a VLIW coprocessor has been configured
and enabled through command line options.
<P>

<DT><CODE>warn_unused_result</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1265"></A>
The <CODE>warn_unused_result</CODE> attribute causes a warning to be emitted
if a caller of the function with this attribute does not use its
return value.  This is useful for functions where not checking
the result is either a security problem or always a bug, such as
<CODE>realloc</CODE>.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int fn () __attribute__ ((warn_unused_result));
int foo ()
{
  if (fn () &#60; 0) return -1;

}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

results in warning on line 5.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>weak</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1266"></A>
The <CODE>weak</CODE> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
library functions which can be overridden in user code, though it can
also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are supported
for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using the GNU assembler
and linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>weakref</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>weakref ("<VAR>target</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1267"></A>
The <CODE>weakref</CODE> attribute marks a declaration as a weak reference.
Without arguments, it should be accompanied by an <CODE>alias</CODE> attribute
naming the target symbol.  Optionally, the <VAR>target</VAR> may be given as
an argument to <CODE>weakref</CODE> itself.  In either case, <CODE>weakref</CODE>
implicitly marks the declaration as <CODE>weak</CODE>.  Without a
<VAR>target</VAR>, given as an argument to <CODE>weakref</CODE> or to <CODE>alias</CODE>,
<CODE>weakref</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>weak</CODE>.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static int x() __attribute__ ((weakref ("y")));
/* is equivalent to... */
static int x() __attribute__ ((weak, weakref, alias ("y")));
/* and to... */
static int x() __attribute__ ((weakref));
static int x() __attribute__ ((alias ("y")));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A weak reference is an alias that does not by itself require a
definition to be given for the target symbol.  If the target symbol is
only referenced through weak references, then it becomes a <CODE>weak</CODE>
undefined symbol.  If it is directly referenced, however, then such
strong references prevail, and a definition will be required for the
symbol, not necessarily in the same translation unit.
</P><P>

The effect is equivalent to moving all references to the alias to a
separate translation unit, renaming the alias to the aliased symbol,
declaring it as weak, compiling the two separate translation units and
performing a reloadable link on them.
</P><P>

At present, a declaration to which <CODE>weakref</CODE> is attached can
only be <CODE>static</CODE>.
</P><P>

</DL>
<P>

You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by separating them
by commas within the double parentheses or by immediately following an
attribute declaration with another attribute declaration.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1268"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1269"></A>
Some people object to the <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> feature, suggesting that
ISO C's <CODE>#pragma</CODE> should be used instead.  At the time
<CODE>__attribute__</CODE> was designed, there were two reasons for not doing
this.
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
It is impossible to generate <CODE>#pragma</CODE> commands from a macro.
<P>

<LI>
There is no telling what the same <CODE>#pragma</CODE> might mean in another
compiler.
</OL>
<P>

These two reasons applied to almost any application that might have been
proposed for <CODE>#pragma</CODE>.  It was basically a mistake to use
<CODE>#pragma</CODE> for <EM>anything</EM>.
</P><P>

The ISO C99 standard includes <CODE>_Pragma</CODE>, which now allows pragmas
to be generated from macros.  In addition, a <CODE>#pragma GCC</CODE>
namespace is now in use for GCC-specific pragmas.  However, it has been
found convenient to use <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> to achieve a natural
attachment of attributes to their corresponding declarations, whereas
<CODE>#pragma GCC</CODE> is of use for constructs that do not naturally form
part of the grammar.  See section `Miscellaneous Preprocessing Directives' in <CITE>The GNU C Preprocessor</CITE>.

<H2> 6.31 Attribute Syntax </H2>
<!--docid::SEC87::-->
<P>

This section describes the syntax with which <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> may be
used, and the constructs to which attribute specifiers bind, for the C
language.  Some details may vary for C++ and Objective-C.  Because of
infelicities in the grammar for attributes, some forms described here
may not be successfully parsed in all cases.
</P><P>

There are some problems with the semantics of attributes in C++.  For
example, there are no manglings for attributes, although they may affect
code generation, so problems may arise when attributed types are used in
conjunction with templates or overloading.  Similarly, <CODE>typeid</CODE>
does not distinguish between types with different attributes.  Support
for attributes in C++ may be restricted in future to attributes on
declarations only, but not on nested declarators.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>, for details of the semantics of attributes
applying to functions.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>, for details of the
semantics of attributes applying to variables.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC93">6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types</A>,
for details of the semantics of attributes applying to structure, union
and enumerated types.
</P><P>

An <EM>attribute specifier</EM> is of the form
<CODE>__attribute__ ((<VAR>attribute-list</VAR>))</CODE>.  An <EM>attribute list</EM>
is a possibly empty comma-separated sequence of <EM>attributes</EM>, where
each attribute is one of the following:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Empty.  Empty attributes are ignored.
<P>

<LI>
A word (which may be an identifier such as <CODE>unused</CODE>, or a reserved
word such as <CODE>const</CODE>).
<P>

<LI>
A word, followed by, in parentheses, parameters for the attribute.
These parameters take one of the following forms:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
An identifier.  For example, <CODE>mode</CODE> attributes use this form.
<P>

<LI>
An identifier followed by a comma and a non-empty comma-separated list
of expressions.  For example, <CODE>format</CODE> attributes use this form.
<P>

<LI>
A possibly empty comma-separated list of expressions.  For example,
<CODE>format_arg</CODE> attributes use this form with the list being a single
integer constant expression, and <CODE>alias</CODE> attributes use this form
with the list being a single string constant.
</UL>
</UL>
<P>

An <EM>attribute specifier list</EM> is a sequence of one or more attribute
specifiers, not separated by any other tokens.
</P><P>

In GNU C, an attribute specifier list may appear after the colon following a
label, other than a <CODE>case</CODE> or <CODE>default</CODE> label.  The only
attribute it makes sense to use after a label is <CODE>unused</CODE>.  This
feature is intended for code generated by programs which contains labels
that may be unused but which is compiled with <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>.  It would
not normally be appropriate to use in it human-written code, though it
could be useful in cases where the code that jumps to the label is
contained within an <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> conditional.  GNU C++ only permits
attributes on labels if the attribute specifier is immediately
followed by a semicolon (i.e., the label applies to an empty
statement).  If the semicolon is missing, C++ label attributes are
ambiguous, as it is permissible for a declaration, which could begin
with an attribute list, to be labelled in C++.  Declarations cannot be
labelled in C90 or C99, so the ambiguity does not arise there.
</P><P>

An attribute specifier list may appear as part of a <CODE>struct</CODE>,
<CODE>union</CODE> or <CODE>enum</CODE> specifier.  It may go either immediately
after the <CODE>struct</CODE>, <CODE>union</CODE> or <CODE>enum</CODE> keyword, or after
the closing brace.  The former syntax is preferred.
Where attribute specifiers follow the closing brace, they are considered
to relate to the structure, union or enumerated type defined, not to any
enclosing declaration the type specifier appears in, and the type
defined is not complete until after the attribute specifiers.
</P><P>

Otherwise, an attribute specifier appears as part of a declaration,
counting declarations of unnamed parameters and type names, and relates
to that declaration (which may be nested in another declaration, for
example in the case of a parameter declaration), or to a particular declarator
within a declaration.  Where an
attribute specifier is applied to a parameter declared as a function or
an array, it should apply to the function or array rather than the
pointer to which the parameter is implicitly converted, but this is not
yet correctly implemented.
</P><P>

Any list of specifiers and qualifiers at the start of a declaration may
contain attribute specifiers, whether or not such a list may in that
context contain storage class specifiers.  (Some attributes, however,
are essentially in the nature of storage class specifiers, and only make
sense where storage class specifiers may be used; for example,
<CODE>section</CODE>.)  There is one necessary limitation to this syntax: the
first old-style parameter declaration in a function definition cannot
begin with an attribute specifier, because such an attribute applies to
the function instead by syntax described below (which, however, is not
yet implemented in this case).  In some other cases, attribute
specifiers are permitted by this grammar but not yet supported by the
compiler.  All attribute specifiers in this place relate to the
declaration as a whole.  In the obsolescent usage where a type of
<CODE>int</CODE> is implied by the absence of type specifiers, such a list of
specifiers and qualifiers may be an attribute specifier list with no
other specifiers or qualifiers.
</P><P>

At present, the first parameter in a function prototype must have some
type specifier which is not an attribute specifier; this resolves an
ambiguity in the interpretation of <CODE>void f(int
(__attribute__((foo)) x))</CODE>, but is subject to change.  At present, if
the parentheses of a function declarator contain only attributes then
those attributes are ignored, rather than yielding an error or warning
or implying a single parameter of type int, but this is subject to
change.
</P><P>

An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before a declarator
(other than the first) in a comma-separated list of declarators in a
declaration of more than one identifier using a single list of
specifiers and qualifiers.  Such attribute specifiers apply
only to the identifier before whose declarator they appear.  For
example, in
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>__attribute__((noreturn)) void d0 (void),
    __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2))) d1 (const char *, ...),
     d2 (void)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the <CODE>noreturn</CODE> attribute applies to all the functions
declared; the <CODE>format</CODE> attribute only applies to <CODE>d1</CODE>.
</P><P>

An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before the comma,
<CODE>=</CODE> or semicolon terminating the declaration of an identifier other
than a function definition.  Such attribute specifiers apply
to the declared object or function.  Where an
assembler name for an object or function is specified (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC104">6.43 Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code</A>), the attribute must follow the <CODE>asm</CODE>
specification.
</P><P>

An attribute specifier list may, in future, be permitted to appear after
the declarator in a function definition (before any old-style parameter
declarations or the function body).
</P><P>

Attribute specifiers may be mixed with type qualifiers appearing inside
the <CODE>[]</CODE> of a parameter array declarator, in the C99 construct by
which such qualifiers are applied to the pointer to which the array is
implicitly converted.  Such attribute specifiers apply to the pointer,
not to the array, but at present this is not implemented and they are
ignored.
</P><P>

An attribute specifier list may appear at the start of a nested
declarator.  At present, there are some limitations in this usage: the
attributes correctly apply to the declarator, but for most individual
attributes the semantics this implies are not implemented.
When attribute specifiers follow the <CODE>*</CODE> of a pointer
declarator, they may be mixed with any type qualifiers present.
The following describes the formal semantics of this syntax.  It will make the
most sense if you are familiar with the formal specification of
declarators in the ISO C standard.
</P><P>

Consider (as in C99 subclause 6.7.5 paragraph 4) a declaration <CODE>T
D1</CODE>, where <CODE>T</CODE> contains declaration specifiers that specify a type
<VAR>Type</VAR> (such as <CODE>int</CODE>) and <CODE>D1</CODE> is a declarator that
contains an identifier <VAR>ident</VAR>.  The type specified for <VAR>ident</VAR>
for derived declarators whose type does not include an attribute
specifier is as in the ISO C standard.
</P><P>

If <CODE>D1</CODE> has the form <CODE>( <VAR>attribute-specifier-list</VAR> D )</CODE>,
and the declaration <CODE>T D</CODE> specifies the type
"<VAR>derived-declarator-type-list</VAR> <VAR>Type</VAR>" for <VAR>ident</VAR>, then
<CODE>T D1</CODE> specifies the type "<VAR>derived-declarator-type-list</VAR>
<VAR>attribute-specifier-list</VAR> <VAR>Type</VAR>" for <VAR>ident</VAR>.
</P><P>

If <CODE>D1</CODE> has the form <CODE>*
<VAR>type-qualifier-and-attribute-specifier-list</VAR> D</CODE>, and the
declaration <CODE>T D</CODE> specifies the type
"<VAR>derived-declarator-type-list</VAR> <VAR>Type</VAR>" for <VAR>ident</VAR>, then
<CODE>T D1</CODE> specifies the type "<VAR>derived-declarator-type-list</VAR>
<VAR>type-qualifier-and-attribute-specifier-list</VAR> pointer to <VAR>Type</VAR>" for
<VAR>ident</VAR>.
</P><P>

For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void (__attribute__((noreturn)) ****f) (void);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

specifies the type "pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to
non-returning function returning <CODE>void</CODE>".  As another example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>char *__attribute__((aligned(8))) *f;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

specifies the type "pointer to 8-byte-aligned pointer to <CODE>char</CODE>".
Note again that this does not work with most attributes; for example,
the usage of <SAMP>`aligned'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`noreturn'</SAMP> attributes given above
is not yet supported.
</P><P>

For compatibility with existing code written for compiler versions that
did not implement attributes on nested declarators, some laxity is
allowed in the placing of attributes.  If an attribute that only applies
to types is applied to a declaration, it will be treated as applying to
the type of that declaration.  If an attribute that only applies to
declarations is applied to the type of a declaration, it will be treated
as applying to that declaration; and, for compatibility with code
placing the attributes immediately before the identifier declared, such
an attribute applied to a function return type will be treated as
applying to the function type, and such an attribute applied to an array
element type will be treated as applying to the array type.  If an
attribute that only applies to function types is applied to a
pointer-to-function type, it will be treated as applying to the pointer
target type; if such an attribute is applied to a function return type
that is not a pointer-to-function type, it will be treated as applying
to the function type.

<H2> 6.32 Prototypes and Old-Style Function Definitions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC88::-->
<P>

GNU C extends ISO C to allow a function prototype to override a later
old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>/* Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.  */
#ifdef __STDC__
#define P(x) x
#else
#define P(x) ()
#endif

/* Prototype function declaration.  */
int isroot P((uid_t));

/* Old-style function definition.  */
int
isroot (x)   /* ??? lossage here ??? */
     uid_t x;
{
  return x == 0;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Suppose the type <CODE>uid_t</CODE> happens to be <CODE>short</CODE>.  ISO C does
not allow this example, because subword arguments in old-style
non-prototype definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the
function definition's argument is really an <CODE>int</CODE>, which does not
match the prototype argument type of <CODE>short</CODE>.
</P><P>

This restriction of ISO C makes it hard to write code that is portable
to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not know
whether the <CODE>uid_t</CODE> type is <CODE>short</CODE>, <CODE>int</CODE>, or
<CODE>long</CODE>.  Therefore, in cases like these GNU C allows a prototype
to override a later old-style definition.  More precisely, in GNU C, a
function prototype argument type overrides the argument type specified
by a later old-style definition if the former type is the same as the
latter type before promotion.  Thus in GNU C the above example is
equivalent to the following:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int isroot (uid_t);

int
isroot (uid_t x)
{
  return x == 0;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

GNU C++ does not support old-style function definitions, so this
extension is irrelevant.

<H2> 6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables </H2>
<!--docid::SEC92::-->
<P>

The keyword <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> allows you to specify special
attributes of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed
by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Some
attributes are currently defined generically for variables.
Other attributes are defined for variables on particular target
systems.  Other attributes are available for functions
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>) and for types (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC93">6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types</A>).
Other front ends might define more attributes
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC134">Extensions to the C++ Language</A>).
</P><P>

You may also specify attributes with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <CODE>__aligned__</CODE> instead of <CODE>aligned</CODE>.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC87">6.31 Attribute Syntax</A>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1270"></A>
<DT><CODE>aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

causes the compiler to allocate the global variable <CODE>x</CODE> on a
16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction with
an <CODE>asm</CODE> expression to access the <CODE>move16</CODE> instruction which
requires 16-byte aligned operands.
</P><P>

You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For example, to
create a double-word aligned <CODE>int</CODE> pair, you could write:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is an alternative to creating a union with a <CODE>double</CODE> member
that forces the union to be double-word aligned.
</P><P>

As in the preceding examples, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given variable or
structure field.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a variable or field to the
default alignment for the target architecture you are compiling for.
The default alignment is sufficient for all scalar types, but may not be
enough for all vector types on a target which supports vector operations.
The default alignment is fixed for a particular target ABI.
</P><P>

Gcc also provides a target specific macro <CODE>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</CODE>,
which is the largest alignment ever used for any data type on the
target machine you are compiling for.  For example, you could write:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>short array[3] __attribute__ ((aligned (__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The compiler automatically sets the alignment for the declared
variable or field to <CODE>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</CODE>.  Doing this can
often make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can
use whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when
performing copies to or from the variables or fields that you have
aligned this way.  Note that the value of <CODE>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</CODE>
may change depending on command line options.
</P><P>

When used on a struct, or struct member, the <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute can
only increase the alignment; in order to decrease it, the <CODE>packed</CODE>
attribute must be specified as well.  When used as part of a typedef, the
<CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute can both increase and decrease alignment, and
specifying the <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute will generate a warning.
</P><P>

Note that the effectiveness of <CODE>aligned</CODE> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <CODE>aligned(16)</CODE>
in an <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.
</P><P>

The <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute can also be used for functions
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>.)
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>cleanup (<VAR>cleanup_function</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1271"></A>
The <CODE>cleanup</CODE> attribute runs a function when the variable goes
out of scope.  This attribute can only be applied to auto function
scope variables; it may not be applied to parameters or variables
with static storage duration.  The function must take one parameter,
a pointer to a type compatible with the variable.  The return value
of the function (if any) is ignored.
<P>

If <SAMP>`-fexceptions'</SAMP> is enabled, then <VAR>cleanup_function</VAR>
will be run during the stack unwinding that happens during the
processing of the exception.  Note that the <CODE>cleanup</CODE> attribute
does not allow the exception to be caught, only to perform an action.
It is undefined what happens if <VAR>cleanup_function</VAR> does not
return normally.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>common</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>nocommon</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1272"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1273"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1274"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1275"></A>
The <CODE>common</CODE> attribute requests GCC to place a variable in
"common" storage.  The <CODE>nocommon</CODE> attribute requests the
opposite--to allocate space for it directly.
<P>

These attributes override the default chosen by the
<SAMP>`-fno-common'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fcommon'</SAMP> flags respectively.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>deprecated</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>deprecated (<VAR>msg</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1276"></A>
The <CODE>deprecated</CODE> attribute results in a warning if the variable
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
variables that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated variable, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the variable is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warning only occurs for uses:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern int old_var __attribute__ ((deprecated));
extern int old_var;
int new_fn () { return old_var; }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.  The optional msg
argument, which must be a string, will be printed in the warning if
present.
</P><P>

The <CODE>deprecated</CODE> attribute can also be used for functions and
types (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>, see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC93">6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types</A>.)
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>mode (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1277"></A>
This attribute specifies the data type for the declaration--whichever
type corresponds to the mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  This in effect lets you
request an integer or floating point type according to its width.
<P>

You may also specify a mode of <SAMP>`byte'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`__byte__'</SAMP> to
indicate the mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, <SAMP>`word'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`__word__'</SAMP> for the mode of a one-word integer, and <SAMP>`pointer'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`__pointer__'</SAMP> for the mode used to represent pointers.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>packed</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1278"></A>
The <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a variable,
and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
<CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute.
<P>

Here is a structure in which the field <CODE>x</CODE> is packed, so that it
immediately follows <CODE>a</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct foo
{
  char a;
  int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<EM>Note:</EM> The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the
<CODE>packed</CODE> attribute on bit-fields of type <CODE>char</CODE>.  This has
been fixed in GCC 4.4 but the change can lead to differences in the
structure layout.  See the documentation of
<SAMP>`-Wpacked-bitfield-compat'</SAMP> for more information.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>section ("<VAR>section-name</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1279"></A>
Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections like
<CODE>data</CODE> and <CODE>bss</CODE>.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections,
or you need certain particular variables to appear in special sections,
for example to map to special hardware.  The <CODE>section</CODE>
attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives in a particular
section.  For example, this small program uses several specific section names:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct duart a __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
struct duart b __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
char stack[10000] __attribute__ ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
int init_data __attribute__ ((section ("INITDATA")));

main()
{
  /* Initialize stack pointer */
  init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));

  /* Initialize initialized data */
  memcpy (&#38;init_data, &#38;data, &#38;edata - &#38;data);

  /* Turn on the serial ports */
  init_duart (&#38;a);
  init_duart (&#38;b);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Use the <CODE>section</CODE> attribute with
<EM>global</EM> variables and not <EM>local</EM> variables,
as shown in the example.
</P><P>

You may use the <CODE>section</CODE> attribute with initialized or
uninitialized global variables but the linker requires
each object be defined once, with the exception that uninitialized
variables tentatively go in the <CODE>common</CODE> (or <CODE>bss</CODE>) section
and can be multiply "defined".  Using the <CODE>section</CODE> attribute
will change what section the variable goes into and may cause the
linker to issue an error if an uninitialized variable has multiple
definitions.  You can force a variable to be initialized with the
<SAMP>`-fno-common'</SAMP> flag or the <CODE>nocommon</CODE> attribute.
</P><P>

Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <CODE>section</CODE>
attribute is not available on all platforms.
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>shared</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1280"></A>
On Microsoft Windows, in addition to putting variable definitions in a named
section, the section can also be shared among all running copies of an
executable or DLL.  For example, this small program defines shared data
by putting it in a named section <CODE>shared</CODE> and marking the section
shareable:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int foo __attribute__((section ("shared"), shared)) = 0;

int
main()
{
  /* Read and write foo.  All running
     copies see the same value.  */
  return 0;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You may only use the <CODE>shared</CODE> attribute along with <CODE>section</CODE>
attribute with a fully initialized global definition because of the way
linkers work.  See <CODE>section</CODE> attribute for more information.
</P><P>

The <CODE>shared</CODE> attribute is only available on Microsoft Windows.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>tls_model ("<VAR>tls_model</VAR>")</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1281"></A>
The <CODE>tls_model</CODE> attribute sets thread-local storage model
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC130">6.58 Thread-Local Storage</A>) of a particular <CODE>__thread</CODE> variable,
overriding <SAMP>`-ftls-model='</SAMP> command-line switch on a per-variable
basis.
The <VAR>tls_model</VAR> argument should be one of <CODE>global-dynamic</CODE>,
<CODE>local-dynamic</CODE>, <CODE>initial-exec</CODE> or <CODE>local-exec</CODE>.
<P>

Not all targets support this attribute.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>unused</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable is meant
to be possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for this
variable.
<P>

<DT><CODE>used</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable must be
emitted even if it appears that the variable is not referenced.
<P>

When applied to a static data member of a C++ class template, the
attribute also means that the member will be instantiated if the
class itself is instantiated.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>vector_size (<VAR>bytes</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies the vector size for the variable, measured in
bytes.  For example, the declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int foo __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

causes the compiler to set the mode for <CODE>foo</CODE>, to be 16 bytes,
divided into <CODE>int</CODE> sized units.  Assuming a 32-bit int (a vector of
4 units of 4 bytes), the corresponding mode of <CODE>foo</CODE> will be V4SI.
</P><P>

This attribute is only applicable to integral and float scalars,
although arrays, pointers, and function return values are allowed in
conjunction with this construct.
</P><P>

Aggregates with this attribute are invalid, even if they are of the same
size as a corresponding scalar.  For example, the declaration:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct S { int a; };
struct S  __attribute__ ((vector_size (16))) foo;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is invalid even if the size of the structure is the same as the size of
the <CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>selectany</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>selectany</CODE> attribute causes an initialized global variable to
have link-once semantics.  When multiple definitions of the variable are
encountered by the linker, the first is selected and the remainder are
discarded.  Following usage by the Microsoft compiler, the linker is told
<EM>not</EM> to warn about size or content differences of the multiple
definitions.
<P>

Although the primary usage of this attribute is for POD types, the
attribute can also be applied to global C++ objects that are initialized
by a constructor.  In this case, the static initialization and destruction
code for the object is emitted in each translation defining the object,
but the calls to the constructor and destructor are protected by a
link-once guard variable.
</P><P>

The <CODE>selectany</CODE> attribute is only available on Microsoft Windows
targets.  You can use <CODE>__declspec (selectany)</CODE> as a synonym for
<CODE>__attribute__ ((selectany))</CODE> for compatibility with other
compilers.

<H2> 6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types </H2>
<!--docid::SEC93::-->
<P>

The keyword <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> allows you to specify special
attributes of <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> types when you define
such types.  This keyword is followed by an attribute specification
inside double parentheses.  Seven attributes are currently defined for
types: <CODE>aligned</CODE>, <CODE>packed</CODE>, <CODE>transparent_union</CODE>,
<CODE>unused</CODE>, <CODE>deprecated</CODE>, <CODE>visibility</CODE>, and
<CODE>may_alias</CODE>.  Other attributes are defined for functions
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>) and for variables (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>).
</P><P>

You may also specify any one of these attributes with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP>
preceding and following its keyword.  This allows you to use these
attributes in header files without being concerned about a possible
macro of the same name.  For example, you may use <CODE>__aligned__</CODE>
instead of <CODE>aligned</CODE>.
</P><P>

You may specify type attributes in an enum, struct or union type
declaration or definition, or for other types in a <CODE>typedef</CODE>
declaration.
</P><P>

For an enum, struct or union type, you may specify attributes either
between the enum, struct or union tag and the name of the type, or
just past the closing curly brace of the <EM>definition</EM>.  The
former syntax is preferred.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC87">6.31 Attribute Syntax</A>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1282"></A>
<DT><CODE>aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for variables
of the specified type.  For example, the declarations:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

force the compiler to insure (as far as it can) that each variable whose
type is <CODE>struct S</CODE> or <CODE>more_aligned_int</CODE> will be allocated and
aligned <EM>at least</EM> on a 8-byte boundary.  On a SPARC, having all
variables of type <CODE>struct S</CODE> aligned to 8-byte boundaries allows
the compiler to use the <CODE>ldd</CODE> and <CODE>std</CODE> (doubleword load and
store) instructions when copying one variable of type <CODE>struct S</CODE> to
another, thus improving run-time efficiency.
</P><P>

Note that the alignment of any given <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE> type
is required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of
the <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE> in question.  This means that you <EM>can</EM>
effectively adjust the alignment of a <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE>
type by attaching an <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute to any one of the members
of such a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above is a
more obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the compiler to
adjust the alignment of an entire <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE> type.
</P><P>

As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given <CODE>struct</CODE>
or <CODE>union</CODE> type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a type to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <CODE>aligned</CODE>
attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment
for the type to the largest alignment which is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often
make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use
whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing
copies to or from the variables which have types that you have aligned
this way.
</P><P>

In the example above, if the size of each <CODE>short</CODE> is 2 bytes, then
the size of the entire <CODE>struct S</CODE> type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
power of two which is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
compiler sets the alignment for the entire <CODE>struct S</CODE> type to 8
bytes.
</P><P>

Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a time-efficient
alignment for a given type and then declare only individual stand-alone
objects of that type, the compiler's ability to select a time-efficient
alignment is primarily useful only when you plan to create arrays of
variables having the relevant (efficiently aligned) type.  If you
declare or use arrays of variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then
it is likely that your program will also be doing pointer arithmetic (or
subscripting, which amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the
relevant type, and the code that the compiler generates for these
pointer arithmetic operations will often be more efficient for
efficiently-aligned types than for other types.
</P><P>

The <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
can decrease it by specifying <CODE>packed</CODE> as well.  See below.
</P><P>

Note that the effectiveness of <CODE>aligned</CODE> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <CODE>aligned(16)</CODE>
in an <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>packed</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE> type
definition, specifies that each member (other than zero-width bitfields)
of the structure or union is placed to minimize the memory required.  When
attached to an <CODE>enum</CODE> definition, it indicates that the smallest
integral type should be used.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1283"></A>
Specifying this attribute for <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> types is
equivalent to specifying the <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute on each of the
structure or union members.  Specifying the <SAMP>`-fshort-enums'</SAMP>
flag on the line is equivalent to specifying the <CODE>packed</CODE>
attribute on all <CODE>enum</CODE> definitions.
</P><P>

In the following example <CODE>struct my_packed_struct</CODE>'s members are
packed closely together, but the internal layout of its <CODE>s</CODE> member
is not packed--to do that, <CODE>struct my_unpacked_struct</CODE> would need to
be packed too.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct my_unpacked_struct
 {
    char c;
    int i;
 };

struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) my_packed_struct
  {
     char c;
     int  i;
     struct my_unpacked_struct s;
  };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You may only specify this attribute on the definition of an <CODE>enum</CODE>,
<CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE>, not on a <CODE>typedef</CODE> which does not
also define the enumerated type, structure or union.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>transparent_union</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to a <CODE>union</CODE> type definition, indicates
that any function parameter having that union type causes calls to that
function to be treated in a special way.
<P>

First, the argument corresponding to a transparent union type can be of
any type in the union; no cast is required.  Also, if the union contains
a pointer type, the corresponding argument can be a null pointer
constant or a void pointer expression; and if the union contains a void
pointer type, the corresponding argument can be any pointer expression.
If the union member type is a pointer, qualifiers like <CODE>const</CODE> on
the referenced type must be respected, just as with normal pointer
conversions.
</P><P>

Second, the argument is passed to the function using the calling
conventions of the first member of the transparent union, not the calling
conventions of the union itself.  All members of the union must have the
same machine representation; this is necessary for this argument passing
to work properly.
</P><P>

Transparent unions are designed for library functions that have multiple
interfaces for compatibility reasons.  For example, suppose the
<CODE>wait</CODE> function must accept either a value of type <CODE>int *</CODE> to
comply with Posix, or a value of type <CODE>union wait *</CODE> to comply with
the 4.1BSD interface.  If <CODE>wait</CODE>'s parameter were <CODE>void *</CODE>,
<CODE>wait</CODE> would accept both kinds of arguments, but it would also
accept any other pointer type and this would make argument type checking
less useful.  Instead, <CODE>&#60;sys/wait.h&#62;</CODE> might define the interface
as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef union __attribute__ ((__transparent_union__))
  {
    int *__ip;
    union wait *__up;
  } wait_status_ptr_t;

pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This interface allows either <CODE>int *</CODE> or <CODE>union wait *</CODE>
arguments to be passed, using the <CODE>int *</CODE> calling convention.
The program can call <CODE>wait</CODE> with arguments of either type:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int w1 () { int w; return wait (&#38;w); }
int w2 () { union wait w; return wait (&#38;w); }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

With this interface, <CODE>wait</CODE>'s implementation might look like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t p)
{
  return waitpid (-1, p.__ip, 0);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>unused</CODE>
<DD>When attached to a type (including a <CODE>union</CODE> or a <CODE>struct</CODE>),
this attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for any variables of
that type, even if the variable appears to do nothing.  This is often
the case with lock or thread classes, which are usually defined and then
not referenced, but contain constructors and destructors that have
nontrivial bookkeeping functions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>deprecated</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>deprecated (<VAR>msg</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>deprecated</CODE> attribute results in a warning if the type
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
types that are expected to be removed in a future version of a program.
If possible, the warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated type, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the type is deprecated, or what they should do
instead.  Note that the warnings only occur for uses and then only
if the type is being applied to an identifier that itself is not being
declared as deprecated.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int T1 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
T1 x;
typedef T1 T2;
T2 y;
typedef T1 T3 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
T3 z __attribute__ ((deprecated));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

results in a warning on line 2 and 3 but not lines 4, 5, or 6.  No
warning is issued for line 4 because T2 is not explicitly
deprecated.  Line 5 has no warning because T3 is explicitly
deprecated.  Similarly for line 6.  The optional msg
argument, which must be a string, will be printed in the warning if
present.
</P><P>

The <CODE>deprecated</CODE> attribute can also be used for functions and
variables (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>, see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>.)
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>may_alias</CODE>
<DD>Accesses through pointers to types with this attribute are not subject
to type-based alias analysis, but are instead assumed to be able to alias
any other type of objects.  In the context of 6.5/7 an lvalue expression
dereferencing such a pointer is treated like having a character type.
See <SAMP>`-fstrict-aliasing'</SAMP> for more information on aliasing issues.
This extension exists to support some vector APIs, in which pointers to
one vector type are permitted to alias pointers to a different vector type.
<P>

Note that an object of a type with this attribute does not have any
special semantics.
</P><P>

Example of use:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef short __attribute__((__may_alias__)) short_a;

int
main (void)
{
  int a = 0x12345678;
  short_a *b = (short_a *) &#38;a;

  b[1] = 0;

  if (a == 0x12345678)
    abort();

  exit(0);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you replaced <CODE>short_a</CODE> with <CODE>short</CODE> in the variable
declaration, the above program would abort when compiled with
<SAMP>`-fstrict-aliasing'</SAMP>, which is on by default at <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> or
above in recent GCC versions.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>visibility</CODE>
<DD>In C++, attribute visibility (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>) can also be
applied to class, struct, union and enum types.  Unlike other type
attributes, the attribute must appear between the initial keyword and
the name of the type; it cannot appear after the body of the type.
<P>

Note that the type visibility is applied to vague linkage entities
associated with the class (vtable, typeinfo node, etc.).  In
particular, if a class is thrown as an exception in one shared object
and caught in another, the class must have default visibility.
Otherwise the two shared objects will be unable to use the same
typeinfo node and exception handling will break.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>bit_order</CODE>
<DD>Normally, GCC allocates bitfields from either the least significant or
most significant bit in the underlying type, such that bitfields
happen to be allocated from lowest address to highest address.
Specifically, big-endian targets allocate the MSB first, where
little-endian targets allocate the LSB first.  The <CODE>bit_order</CODE>
attribute overrides this default, allowing you to force allocation to
be MSB-first, LSB-first, or the opposite of whatever gcc defaults to.  The
<CODE>bit_order</CODE> attribute takes an optional argument:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>native</CODE>
<DD>This is the default, and also the mode when no argument is given.  GCC
allocates LSB-first on little endian targets, and MSB-first on big
endian targets.
<P>

<DT><CODE>swapped</CODE>
<DD>Bitfield allocation is the opposite of <CODE>native</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>lsb</CODE>
<DD>Bits are allocated LSB-first.
<P>

<DT><CODE>msb</CODE>
<DD>Bits are allocated MSB-first.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

A short example demonstrates bitfield allocation:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct __attribute__((bit_order(msb))) {
  char a:3;
  char b:3;
} foo = { 3, 5 };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

With LSB-first allocation, <CODE>foo.a</CODE> will be in the 3 least
significant bits (mask 0x07) and <CODE>foo.b</CODE> will be in the next 3
bits (mask 0x38).  With MSB-first allocation, <CODE>foo.a</CODE> will be in
the 3 most significant bits (mask 0xE0) and <CODE>foo.b</CODE> will be in
the next 3 bits (mask 0x1C).
</P><P>

Note that it is entirely up to the programmer to define bitfields that
make sense when swapped.  Consider:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct __attribute__((bit_order(msb))) {
  short a:7;
  char b:6;
} foo = { 3, 5 };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

On some targets, or if the struct is <CODE>packed</CODE>, GCC may only use
one byte of storage for A despite it being a <CODE>short</CODE> type.
Swapping the bit order of A would cause it to overlap B.  Worse, the
bitfield for B may span bytes, so "swapping" would no longer be
defined as there is no "char" to swap within.  To avoid such
problems, the programmer should either fully-define each underlying
type, or ensure that their target's ABI allocates enough space for
each underlying type regardless of how much of it is used.

<H2> 6.38 Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables </H2>
<!--docid::SEC94::-->
<P>

The keyword <CODE>__alignof__</CODE> allows you to inquire about how an object
is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like <CODE>sizeof</CODE>.
</P><P>

For example, if the target machine requires a <CODE>double</CODE> value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then <CODE>__alignof__ (double)</CODE> is 8.
This is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine
designs, <CODE>__alignof__ (double)</CODE> is 4 or even 2.
</P><P>

Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to any
data type even at an odd address.  For these machines, <CODE>__alignof__</CODE>
reports the smallest alignment that GCC will give the data type, usually as
mandated by the target ABI.
</P><P>

If the operand of <CODE>__alignof__</CODE> is an lvalue rather than a type,
its value is the required alignment for its type, taking into account
any minimum alignment specified with GCC's <CODE>__attribute__</CODE>
extension (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>).  For example, after this
declaration:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the value of <CODE>__alignof__ (foo1.y)</CODE> is 1, even though its actual
alignment is probably 2 or 4, the same as <CODE>__alignof__ (int)</CODE>.
</P><P>

It is an error to ask for the alignment of an incomplete type.

<H2> 6.39 An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro </H2>
<!--docid::SEC95::-->
<P>

By declaring a function inline, you can direct GCC to make
calls to that function faster.  One way GCC can achieve this is to
integrate that function's code into the code for its callers.  This
makes execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their
known values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not
all of the inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on
code size is less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller
with function inlining, depending on the particular case.  You can
also direct GCC to try to integrate all "simple enough" functions
into their callers with the option <SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

GCC implements three different semantics of declaring a function
inline.  One is available with <SAMP>`-std=gnu89'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-fgnu89-inline'</SAMP> or when <CODE>gnu_inline</CODE> attribute is present
on all inline declarations, another when
<SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-std=c11'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-std=gnu99'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std=gnu11'</SAMP>
(without <SAMP>`-fgnu89-inline'</SAMP>), and the third
is used when compiling C++.
</P><P>

To declare a function inline, use the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword in its
declaration, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static inline int
inc (int *a)
{
  return (*a)++;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you are writing a header file to be included in ISO C90 programs, write
<CODE>__inline__</CODE> instead of <CODE>inline</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC108">6.45 Alternate Keywords</A>.
</P><P>

The three types of inlining behave similarly in two important cases:
when the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword is used on a <CODE>static</CODE> function,
like the example above, and when a function is first declared without
using the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword and then is defined with
<CODE>inline</CODE>, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern int inc (int *a);
inline int
inc (int *a)
{
  return (*a)++;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In both of these common cases, the program behaves the same as if you
had not used the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword, except for its speed.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1284"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1285"></A>
When a function is both inline and <CODE>static</CODE>, if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced.
In this case, GCC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option <SAMP>`-fkeep-inline-functions'</SAMP>.
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1286"></A>
Note that certain usages in a function definition can make it unsuitable
for inline substitution.  Among these usages are: use of varargs, use of
alloca, use of variable sized data types (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC75">6.19 Arrays of Variable Length</A>),
use of computed goto (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC57">6.3 Labels as Values</A>), use of nonlocal goto,
and nested functions (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC58">6.4 Nested Functions</A>).  Using <SAMP>`-Winline'</SAMP>
will warn when a function marked <CODE>inline</CODE> could not be substituted,
and will give the reason for the failure.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1287"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1288"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1289"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1290"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1291"></A>
As required by ISO C++, GCC considers member functions defined within
the body of a class to be marked inline even if they are
not explicitly declared with the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword.  You can
override this with <SAMP>`-fno-default-inline'</SAMP>; see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC13">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</A>.
</P><P>

GCC does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you specify
the <SAMP>`always_inline'</SAMP> attribute for the function, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>/* Prototype.  */
inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The remainder of this section is specific to GNU C90 inlining.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1292"></A>
When an inline function is not <CODE>static</CODE>, then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol can
be defined only once in any program, the function must not be defined in
the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be integrated.
Therefore, a non-<CODE>static</CODE> inline function is always compiled on its
own in the usual fashion.
</P><P>

If you specify both <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE> in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.
</P><P>

This combination of <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE> has almost the
effect of a macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in
a header file with these keywords, and put another copy of the
definition (lacking <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE>) in a library file.
The definition in the header file will cause most calls to the function
to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to
the single copy in the library.

</TR></TABLE>
<H2> 6.40 When is a Volatile Object Accessed? </H2>
<!--docid::SEC96::-->
<P>

C has the concept of volatile objects.  These are normally accessed by
pointers and used for accessing hardware or inter-thread
communication.  The standard encourages compilers to refrain from
optimizations concerning accesses to volatile objects, but leaves it
implementation defined as to what constitutes a volatile access.  The
minimum requirement is that at a sequence point all previous accesses
to volatile objects have stabilized and no subsequent accesses have
occurred.  Thus an implementation is free to reorder and combine
volatile accesses which occur between sequence points, but cannot do
so for accesses across a sequence point.  The use of volatile does
not allow you to violate the restriction on updating objects multiple
times between two sequence points.
</P><P>

Accesses to non-volatile objects are not ordered with respect to
volatile accesses.  You cannot use a volatile object as a memory
barrier to order a sequence of writes to non-volatile memory.  For
instance:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int *ptr = <VAR>something</VAR>;
volatile int vobj;
*ptr = <VAR>something</VAR>;
vobj = 1;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Unless <VAR>*ptr</VAR> and <VAR>vobj</VAR> can be aliased, it is not guaranteed
that the write to <VAR>*ptr</VAR> will have occurred by the time the update
of <VAR>vobj</VAR> has happened.  If you need this guarantee, you must use
a stronger memory barrier such as:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int *ptr = <VAR>something</VAR>;
volatile int vobj;
*ptr = <VAR>something</VAR>;
asm volatile ("" : : : "memory");
vobj = 1;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A scalar volatile object is read when it is accessed in a void context:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>volatile int *src = <VAR>somevalue</VAR>;
*src;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Such expressions are rvalues, and GCC implements this as a
read of the volatile object being pointed to.
</P><P>

Assignments are also expressions and have an rvalue.  However when
assigning to a scalar volatile, the volatile object is not reread,
regardless of whether the assignment expression's rvalue is used or
not.  If the assignment's rvalue is used, the value is that assigned
to the volatile object.  For instance, there is no read of <VAR>vobj</VAR>
in all the following cases:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int obj;
volatile int vobj;
vobj = <VAR>something</VAR>;
obj = vobj = <VAR>something</VAR>;
obj ? vobj = <VAR>onething</VAR> : vobj = <VAR>anotherthing</VAR>;
obj = (<VAR>something</VAR>, vobj = <VAR>anotherthing</VAR>);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you need to read the volatile object after an assignment has
occurred, you must use a separate expression with an intervening
sequence point.
</P><P>

As bitfields are not individually addressable, volatile bitfields may
be implicitly read when written to, or when adjacent bitfields are
accessed.  Bitfield operations may be optimized such that adjacent
bitfields are only partially accessed, if they straddle a storage unit
boundary.  For these reasons it is unwise to use volatile bitfields to
access hardware.

<H2> 6.41 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC97::-->
<P>

In an assembler instruction using <CODE>asm</CODE>, you can specify the
operands of the instruction using C expressions.  This means you need not
guess which registers or memory locations will contain the data you want
to use.
</P><P>

You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what
appears in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for
each operand.
</P><P>

For example, here is how to use the 68881's <CODE>fsinx</CODE> instruction:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>angle</CODE> is the C expression for the input operand while
<CODE>result</CODE> is that of the output operand.  Each has <SAMP>`"f"'</SAMP> as its
operand constraint, saying that a floating point register is required.
The <SAMP>`='</SAMP> in <SAMP>`=f'</SAMP> indicates that the operand is an output; all
output operands' constraints must use <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.  The constraints use the
same language used in the machine description (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC99">6.42 Constraints for <CODE>asm</CODE> Operands</A>).
</P><P>

Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by
the C expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler
template from the first output operand and another separates the last
output operand from the first input, if any.  Commas separate the
operands within each group.  The total number of operands is currently
limited to 30; this limitation may be lifted in some future version of
GCC.
</P><P>

If there are no output operands but there are input operands, you must
place two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output
operands would go.
</P><P>

As of GCC version 3.1, it is also possible to specify input and output
operands using symbolic names which can be referenced within the
assembler code.  These names are specified inside square brackets
preceding the constraint string, and can be referenced inside the
assembler code using <CODE>%[<VAR>name</VAR>]</CODE> instead of a percentage sign
followed by the operand number.  Using named operands the above example
could look like:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("fsinx %[angle],%[output]"
     : [output] "=f" (result)
     : [angle] "f" (angle));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that the symbolic operand names have no relation whatsoever to
other C identifiers.  You may use any name you like, even those of
existing C symbols, but you must ensure that no two operands within the same
assembler construct use the same symbolic name.
</P><P>

Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check this.
The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot check
whether the operands have data types that are reasonable for the
instruction being executed.  It does not parse the assembler instruction
template and does not know what it means or even whether it is valid
assembler input.  The extended <CODE>asm</CODE> feature is most often used for
machine instructions the compiler itself does not know exist.  If
the output expression cannot be directly addressed (for example, it is a
bit-field), your constraint must allow a register.  In that case, GCC
will use the register as the output of the <CODE>asm</CODE>, and then store
that register into the output.
</P><P>

The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GCC will assume that
the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need
not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write
operands.  Use the constraint character <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> to indicate such an
operand and list it with the output operands.  You should only use
read-write operands when the constraints for the operand (or the
operand in which only some of the bits are to be changed) allow a
register.
</P><P>

You may, as an alternative, logically split its function into two
separate operands, one input operand and one write-only output
operand.  The connection between them is expressed by constraints
which say they need to be in the same location when the instruction
executes.  You can use the same C expression for both operands, or
different expressions.  For example, here we write the (fictitious)
<SAMP>`combine'</SAMP> instruction with <CODE>bar</CODE> as its read-only source
operand and <CODE>foo</CODE> as its read-write destination:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The constraint <SAMP>`"0"'</SAMP> for operand 1 says that it must occupy the
same location as operand 0.  A number in constraint is allowed only in
an input operand and it must refer to an output operand.
</P><P>

Only a number in the constraint can guarantee that one operand will be in
the same place as another.  The mere fact that <CODE>foo</CODE> is the value
of both operands is not enough to guarantee that they will be in the
same place in the generated assembler code.  The following would not
work reliably:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to be in
different registers; GCC knows no reason not to do so.  For example, the
compiler might find a copy of the value of <CODE>foo</CODE> in one register and
use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in a different
register (copying it afterward to <CODE>foo</CODE>'s own address).  Of course,
since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the assembler
code, the result will not work, but GCC can't tell that.
</P><P>

As of GCC version 3.1, one may write <CODE>[<VAR>name</VAR>]</CODE> instead of
the operand number for a matching constraint.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("cmoveq %1,%2,%[result]"
     : [result] "=r"(result)
     : "r" (test), "r"(new), "[result]"(old));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Sometimes you need to make an <CODE>asm</CODE> operand be a specific register,
but there's no matching constraint letter for that register <EM>by
itself</EM>.  To force the operand into that register, use a local variable
for the operand and specify the register in the variable declaration.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC105">6.44 Variables in Specified Registers</A>.  Then for the <CODE>asm</CODE> operand, use any
register constraint letter that matches the register:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>register int *p1 asm ("r0") = <small>...</small>;
register int *p2 asm ("r1") = <small>...</small>;
register int *result asm ("r0");
asm ("sysint" : "=r" (result) : "0" (p1), "r" (p2));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="Example of asm with clobbered asm reg"></A>
In the above example, beware that a register that is call-clobbered by
the target ABI will be overwritten by any function call in the
assignment, including library calls for arithmetic operators.
Also a register may be clobbered when generating some operations,
like variable shift, memory copy or memory move on x86.
Assuming it is a call-clobbered register, this may happen to <CODE>r0</CODE>
above by the assignment to <CODE>p2</CODE>.  If you have to use such a
register, use temporary variables for expressions between the register
assignment and use:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int t1 = <small>...</small>;
register int *p1 asm ("r0") = <small>...</small>;
register int *p2 asm ("r1") = t1;
register int *result asm ("r0");
asm ("sysint" : "=r" (result) : "0" (p1), "r" (p2));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe this,
write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the names of
the clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a realistic
example for the VAX:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
              : /* no outputs */
              : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
              : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You may not write a clobber description in a way that overlaps with an
input or output operand.  For example, you may not have an operand
describing a register class with one member if you mention that register
in the clobber list.  Variables declared to live in specific registers
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC105">6.44 Variables in Specified Registers</A>), and used as asm input or output operands must
have no part mentioned in the clobber description.
There is no way for you to specify that an input
operand is modified without also specifying it as an output
operand.  Note that if all the output operands you specify are for this
purpose (and hence unused), you will then also need to specify
<CODE>volatile</CODE> for the <CODE>asm</CODE> construct, as described below, to
prevent GCC from deleting the <CODE>asm</CODE> statement as unused.
</P><P>

If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler code,
you will probably have to list the register after the third colon to
tell the compiler the register's value is modified.  In some assemblers,
the register names begin with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>; to produce one <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the
assembler code, you must write <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP> in the input.
</P><P>

If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register, add
<SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> to the list of clobbered registers.  GCC on some machines
represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register;
<SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> serves to name this register.  On other machines, the
condition code is handled differently, and specifying <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> has no
effect.  But it is valid no matter what the machine.
</P><P>

If your assembler instructions access memory in an unpredictable
fashion, add <SAMP>`memory'</SAMP> to the list of clobbered registers.  This
will cause GCC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the
assembler instruction and not optimize stores or loads to that memory.
You will also want to add the <CODE>volatile</CODE> keyword if the memory
affected is not listed in the inputs or outputs of the <CODE>asm</CODE>, as
the <SAMP>`memory'</SAMP> clobber does not count as a side-effect of the
<CODE>asm</CODE>.  If you know how large the accessed memory is, you can add
it as input or output but if this is not known, you should add
<SAMP>`memory'</SAMP>.  As an example, if you access ten bytes of a string, you
can use a memory input like:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{"m"( ({ struct { char x[10]; } *p = (void *)ptr ; *p; }) )}.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that in the following example the memory input is necessary,
otherwise GCC might optimize the store to <CODE>x</CODE> away:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int foo ()
{
  int x = 42;
  int *y = &#38;x;
  int result;
  asm ("magic stuff accessing an 'int' pointed to by '%1'"
        "=&d" (r) : "a" (y), "m" (*y));
  return result;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single
<CODE>asm</CODE> template, separated by the characters normally used in assembly
code for the system.  A combination that works in most places is a newline
to break the line, plus a tab character to move to the instruction field
(written as <SAMP>`\n\t'</SAMP>).  Sometimes semicolons can be used, if the
assembler allows semicolons as a line-breaking character.  Note that some
assembler dialects use semicolons to start a comment.
The input operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered
registers, and neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can
read and write the clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here
is an example of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes the
subroutine <CODE>_foo</CODE> accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("movl %0,r9\n\tmovl %1,r10\n\tcall _foo"
     : /* no outputs */
     : "g" (from), "g" (to)
     : "r9", "r10");
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Unless an output operand has the <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> constraint modifier, GCC
may allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on
the assumption the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced.
This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
more than one instruction.  In such a case, use <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> for each output
operand that may not overlap an input.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC102">6.42.3 Constraint Modifier Characters</A>.
</P><P>

If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler
instruction, you must include a branch and a label in the <CODE>asm</CODE>
construct, as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>asm ("clr %0\n\tfrob %1\n\tbeq 0f\n\tmov #1,%0\n0:"
     : "g" (result)
     : "g" (input));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
and most Unix assemblers do.
</P><P>

Speaking of labels, jumps from one <CODE>asm</CODE> to another are not
supported.  The compiler's optimizers do not know about these jumps, and
therefore they cannot take account of them when deciding how to
optimize.  See  <A HREF="gcc.html#Extended asm with goto">Extended asm with goto</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1293"></A>
Usually the most convenient way to use these <CODE>asm</CODE> instructions is to
encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define sin(x)       \
({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
   asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
   __value; })
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the variable <CODE>__arg</CODE> is used to make sure that the instruction
operates on a proper <CODE>double</CODE> value, and to accept only those
arguments <CODE>x</CODE> which can convert automatically to a <CODE>double</CODE>.
</P><P>

Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct data
type is to use a cast in the <CODE>asm</CODE>.  This is different from using a
variable <CODE>__arg</CODE> in that it converts more different types.  For
example, if the desired type were <CODE>int</CODE>, casting the argument to
<CODE>int</CODE> would accept a pointer with no complaint, while assigning the
argument to an <CODE>int</CODE> variable named <CODE>__arg</CODE> would warn about
using a pointer unless the caller explicitly casts it.
</P><P>

If an <CODE>asm</CODE> has output operands, GCC assumes for optimization
purposes the instruction has no side effects except to change the output
operands.  This does not mean instructions with a side effect cannot be
used, but you must be careful, because the compiler may eliminate them
if the output operands aren't used, or move them out of loops, or
replace two with one if they constitute a common subexpression.  Also,
if your instruction does have a side effect on a variable that otherwise
appears not to change, the old value of the variable may be reused later
if it happens to be found in a register.
</P><P>

You can prevent an <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction from being deleted
by writing the keyword <CODE>volatile</CODE> after
the <CODE>asm</CODE>.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define get_and_set_priority(new)              \
({ int __old;                                  \
   asm volatile ("get_and_set_priority %0, %1" \
                 : "=g" (__old) : "g" (new));  \
   __old; })
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>volatile</CODE> keyword indicates that the instruction has
important side-effects.  GCC will not delete a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE> if
it is reachable.  (The instruction can still be deleted if GCC can
prove that control-flow will never reach the location of the
instruction.)  Note that even a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction
can be moved relative to other code, including across jump
instructions.  For example, on many targets there is a system
register which can be set to control the rounding mode of
floating point operations.  You might try
setting it with a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE>, like this PowerPC example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>       asm volatile("mtfsf 255,%0" : : "f" (fpenv));
       sum = x + y;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This will not work reliably, as the compiler may move the addition back
before the volatile <CODE>asm</CODE>.  To make it work you need to add an
artificial dependency to the <CODE>asm</CODE> referencing a variable in the code
you don't want moved, for example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>    asm volatile ("mtfsf 255,%1" : "=X"(sum): "f"(fpenv));
    sum = x + y;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Similarly, you can't expect a
sequence of volatile <CODE>asm</CODE> instructions to remain perfectly
consecutive.  If you want consecutive output, use a single <CODE>asm</CODE>.
Also, GCC will perform some optimizations across a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE>
instruction; GCC does not "forget everything" when it encounters
a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction the way some other compilers do.
</P><P>

An <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction without any output operands will be treated
identically to a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction.
</P><P>

It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the condition
code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we attempted to
implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.  The problem
is that output operands might need reloading, which would result in
additional following "store" instructions.  On most machines, these
instructions would alter the condition code before there was time to
test it.  This problem doesn't arise for ordinary "test" and
"compare" instructions because they don't have any output operands.
</P><P>

For reasons similar to those described above, it is not possible to give
an assembler instruction access to the condition code left by previous
instructions.
</P><P>

<A NAME="Extended asm with goto"></A>
As of GCC version 4.5, <CODE>asm goto</CODE> may be used to have the assembly
jump to one or more C labels.  In this form, a fifth section after the
clobber list contains a list of all C labels to which the assembly may jump.
Each label operand is implicitly self-named.  The <CODE>asm</CODE> is also assumed
to fall through to the next statement.
</P><P>

This form of <CODE>asm</CODE> is restricted to not have outputs.  This is due
to a internal restriction in the compiler that control transfer instructions
cannot have outputs.  This restriction on <CODE>asm goto</CODE> may be lifted
in some future version of the compiler.  In the mean time, <CODE>asm goto</CODE>
may include a memory clobber, and so leave outputs in memory.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int frob(int x)
{
  int y;
  asm goto ("frob %%r5, %1; jc %l[error]; mov (%2), %%r5"
            : : "r"(x), "r"(&y) : "r5", "memory" : error);
  return y;
 error:
  return -1;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this (inefficient) example, the <CODE>frob</CODE> instruction sets the
carry bit to indicate an error.  The <CODE>jc</CODE> instruction detects
this and branches to the <CODE>error</CODE> label.  Finally, the output
of the <CODE>frob</CODE> instruction (<CODE>%r5</CODE>) is stored into the memory
for variable <CODE>y</CODE>, which is later read by the <CODE>return</CODE> statement.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void doit(void)
{
  int i = 0;
  asm goto ("mfsr %%r1, 123; jmp %%r1;"
            ".pushsection doit_table;"
            ".long %l0, %l1, %l2, %l3;"
            ".popsection"
            : : : "r1" : label1, label2, label3, label4);
  __builtin_unreachable ();

 label1:
  f1();
  return;
 label2:
  f2();
  return;
 label3:
  i = 1;
 label4:
  f3(i);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this (also inefficient) example, the <CODE>mfsr</CODE> instruction reads
an address from some out-of-band machine register, and the following
<CODE>jmp</CODE> instruction branches to that address.  The address read by
the <CODE>mfsr</CODE> instruction is assumed to have been previously set via
some application-specific mechanism to be one of the four values stored
in the <CODE>doit_table</CODE> section.  Finally, the <CODE>asm</CODE> is followed
by a call to <CODE>__builtin_unreachable</CODE> to indicate that the <CODE>asm</CODE>
does not in fact fall through.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define TRACE1(NUM)                         \
  do {                                      \
    asm goto ("0: nop;"                     \
              ".pushsection trace_table;"   \
              ".long 0b, %l0;"              \
              ".popsection"                 \
              : : : : trace#NUM);           \
    if (0) { trace#NUM: trace(); }          \
  } while (0)
#define TRACE  TRACE1(__COUNTER__)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example (which in fact inspired the <CODE>asm goto</CODE> feature)
we want on rare occasions to call the <CODE>trace</CODE> function; on other
occasions we'd like to keep the overhead to the absolute minimum.
The normal code path consists of a single <CODE>nop</CODE> instruction.
However, we record the address of this <CODE>nop</CODE> together with the
address of a label that calls the <CODE>trace</CODE> function.  This allows
the <CODE>nop</CODE> instruction to be patched at runtime to be an
unconditional branch to the stored label.  It is assumed that an
optimizing compiler will move the labeled block out of line, to
optimize the fall through path from the <CODE>asm</CODE>.
</P><P>

If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ISO C
programs, write <CODE>__asm__</CODE> instead of <CODE>asm</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC108">6.45 Alternate Keywords</A>.

<H3> 6.41.1 Size of an <CODE>asm</CODE> </H3>
<!--docid::SEC98::-->
<P>

Some targets require that GCC track the size of each instruction used in
order to generate correct code.  Because the final length of an
<CODE>asm</CODE> is only known by the assembler, GCC must make an estimate as
to how big it will be.  The estimate is formed by counting the number of
statements in the pattern of the <CODE>asm</CODE> and multiplying that by the
length of the longest instruction on that processor.  Statements in the
<CODE>asm</CODE> are identified by newline characters and whatever statement
separator characters are supported by the assembler; on most processors
this is the `<CODE>;</CODE>' character.
</P><P>

Normally, GCC's estimate is perfectly adequate to ensure that correct
code is generated, but it is possible to confuse the compiler if you use
pseudo instructions or assembler macros that expand into multiple real
instructions or if you use assembler directives that expand to more
space in the object file than would be needed for a single instruction.
If this happens then the assembler will produce a diagnostic saying that
a label is unreachable.

<H2> 6.42 Constraints for <CODE>asm</CODE> Operands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC99::-->
<P>

Here are specific details on what constraint letters you can use with
<CODE>asm</CODE> operands.
Constraints can say whether
an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register; whether the
operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of address; whether the
operand may be an immediate constant, and which possible values it may
have.  Constraints can also require two operands to match.
Side-effects aren't allowed in operands of inline <CODE>asm</CODE>, unless
<SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> constraints are used, because there is no guarantee
that the side-effects will happen exactly once in an instruction that can update
the addressing register.

<H3> 6.42.1 Simple Constraints </H3>
<!--docid::SEC100::-->
<P>

The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are
the letters that are allowed:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>whitespace
<DD>Whitespace characters are ignored and can be inserted at any position
except the first.  This enables each alternative for different operands to
be visually aligned in the machine description even if they have different
number of constraints and modifiers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1294"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1295"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`m'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine
supports in general.
Note that the letter used for the general memory constraint can be
re-defined by a back end using the <CODE>TARGET_MEM_CONSTRAINT</CODE> macro.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1296"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1297"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`o'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
<EM>offsettable</EM>.  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode)
may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory
address.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1298"></A>
For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets
supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement
address is not offsettable.  More complicated indirect/indexed
addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other
addressing modes that the machine supports.
</P><P>

Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
operand, the constraint letter <SAMP>`o'</SAMP> is valid only when accompanied
by both <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
and <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1299"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`V'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words, anything that
would fit the <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> constraint but not the <SAMP>`o'</SAMP> constraint.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1300"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either predecrement or
postdecrement) is allowed.  In inline <CODE>asm</CODE> this constraint is only
allowed if the operand is used exactly once in an instruction that can
handle the side-effects.  Not using an operand with <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> in constraint
string in the inline <CODE>asm</CODE> pattern at all or using it in multiple
instructions isn't valid, because the side-effects wouldn't be performed
or would be performed more than once.  Furthermore, on some targets
the operand with <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> in constraint string must be accompanied by
special instruction suffixes like <CODE>%U0</CODE> instruction suffix on PowerPC
or <CODE>%P0</CODE> on IA-64.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1301"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either preincrement or
postincrement) is allowed.  In inline <CODE>asm</CODE> the same restrictions
as for <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> apply.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1302"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1303"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`r'</SAMP>
<DD>A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1304"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1305"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`i'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
assembly time or later.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1306"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`n'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less
than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use <SAMP>`n'</SAMP>
rather than <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1307"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`I'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`J'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>, <small>...</small> <SAMP>`P'</SAMP>
<DD>Other letters in the range <SAMP>`I'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`P'</SAMP> may be defined in
a machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
68000, <SAMP>`I'</SAMP> is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
instructions.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1308"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`E'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate floating operand (expression code <CODE>const_double</CODE>) is
allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same as
that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1309"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`F'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate floating operand (expression code <CODE>const_double</CODE> or
<CODE>const_vector</CODE>) is allowed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1310"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1311"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`G'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`H'</SAMP>
<DD><SAMP>`G'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`H'</SAMP> may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to
permit immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1312"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`s'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit integer is
allowed.
<P>

This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand with a
value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any known
value.  So why use <SAMP>`s'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>?  Sometimes it allows
better code to be generated.
</P><P>

For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible to
use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between -128
and 127, better code results from loading the value into a register and
using the register.  This is because the load into the register can be
done with a <SAMP>`moveq'</SAMP> instruction.  We arrange for this to happen
by defining the letter <SAMP>`K'</SAMP> to mean "any integer outside the
range -128 to 127", and then specifying <SAMP>`Ks'</SAMP> in the operand
constraints.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1313"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`g'</SAMP>
<DD>Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for
registers that are not general registers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1314"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`X'</SAMP>
<DD>Any operand whatsoever is allowed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1315"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1316"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`0'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`2'</SAMP>, <small>...</small> <SAMP>`9'</SAMP>
<DD>An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.  If a
digit is used together with letters within the same alternative, the
digit should come last.
<P>

This number is allowed to be more than a single digit.  If multiple
digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a single
decimal integer.  There is scant chance for ambiguity, since to-date
it has never been desirable that <SAMP>`10'</SAMP> be interpreted as matching
either operand 1 <EM>or</EM> operand 0.  Should this be desired, one
can use multiple alternatives instead.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1318"></A>
This is called a <EM>matching constraint</EM> and what it really means is
that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
which <CODE>asm</CODE> distinguishes.  For example, an add instruction uses
two input operands and an output operand, but on most CISC
machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an
input-output operand:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>addl #35,r12
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.
More precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
constraint.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1319"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1320"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1321"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1322"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`p'</SAMP>
<DD>An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is
for "load address" and "push address" instructions.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1323"></A>
<SAMP>`p'</SAMP> in the constraint must be accompanied by <CODE>address_operand</CODE>
as the predicate in the <CODE>match_operand</CODE>.  This predicate interprets
the mode specified in the <CODE>match_operand</CODE> as the mode of the memory
reference for which the address would be valid.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1324"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1325"></A>

<H3> 6.42.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints </H3>
<!--docid::SEC101::-->
<P>

Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can combine
register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine any kind of
operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory location into
another.
</P><P>

These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An alternative
can be described by a series of letters for each operand.  The overall
constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this operand
from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this operand from
the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last alternative.
</P><P>

If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is valid.
Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many instructions
must be added to copy the operands so that that alternative applies.
The alternative requiring the least copying is chosen.  If two alternatives
need the same amount of copying, the one that comes first is chosen.
These choices can be altered with the <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> characters:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1326"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1327"></A>
<DT><CODE>?</CODE>
<DD>Disparage slightly the alternative that the <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> appears in,
as a choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
this alternative as one unit more costly for each <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> that appears
in it.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1328"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1329"></A>
<DT><CODE>!</CODE>
<DD>Disparage severely the alternative that the <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> appears in.
This alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading,
but if reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.

<H3> 6.42.3 Constraint Modifier Characters </H3>
<!--docid::SEC102::-->
<P>

Here are constraint modifier characters.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1330"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`='</SAMP>
<DD>Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the previous
value is discarded and replaced by output data.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1331"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
<DD>Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.
<P>

When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
which are outputs from it.  <SAMP>`='</SAMP> identifies an output; <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other operands
are assumed to be input only.
</P><P>

If you specify <SAMP>`='</SAMP> or <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> in a constraint, you put it in the
first character of the constraint string.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1332"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1333"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP>
<DD>Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
<EM>earlyclobber</EM> operand, which is modified before the instruction is
finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not lie
in a register that is used as an input operand or as part of any memory
address.
<P>

<SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
requires <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> while others do not.  See, for example, the
<SAMP>`movdf'</SAMP> insn of the 68000.
</P><P>

An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only
use as an input occurs before the early result is written.  Adding
alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce better code
when only some of the inputs can be affected by the earlyclobber.
See, for example, the <SAMP>`mulsi3'</SAMP> insn of the ARM.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> does not obviate the need to write <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1334"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
<DD>Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange the
two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the
constraints.
GCC can only handle one commutative pair in an asm; if you use more,
the compiler may fail.  Note that you need not use the modifier if
the two alternatives are strictly identical; this would only waste
time in the reload pass.  The modifier is not operational after
register allocation, so the result of <CODE>define_peephole2</CODE>
and <CODE>define_split</CODE>s performed after reload cannot rely on
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> to make the intended insn match.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1335"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`#'</SAMP>
<DD>Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
register preferences.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1336"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
<DD>Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
register preferences.  <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> has no effect on the meaning of the
constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.

<H3> 6.42.4 Constraints for Particular Machines </H3>
<!--docid::SEC103::-->
<P>

Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in <CODE>asm</CODE> arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`r'</SAMP> (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC100">6.42.1 Simple Constraints</A>), and
<SAMP>`I'</SAMP>, usually the letter indicating the most common
immediate-constant format.
</P><P>

Each architecture defines additional constraints.  These constraints
are used by the compiler itself for instruction generation, as well as
for <CODE>asm</CODE> statements; therefore, some of the constraints are not
particularly useful for <CODE>asm</CODE>.  Here is a summary of some of the
machine-dependent constraints available on some particular machines;
it includes both constraints that are useful for <CODE>asm</CODE> and
constraints that aren't.  The compiler source file mentioned in the
table heading for each architecture is the definitive reference for
the meanings of that architecture's constraints.

<H2> 6.43 Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code </H2>
<!--docid::SEC104::-->
<P>

You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <CODE>asm</CODE> (or <CODE>__asm__</CODE>)
keyword after the declarator as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <CODE>foo</CODE> in
the assembler code should be <SAMP>`myfoo'</SAMP> rather than the usual
<SAMP>`_foo'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.
</P><P>

It does not make sense to use this feature with a non-static local
variable since such variables do not have assembler names.  If you are
trying to put the variable in a particular register, see <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC105">6.44 Variables in Specified Registers</A>.  GCC presently accepts such code with a warning, but will
probably be changed to issue an error, rather than a warning, in the
future.
</P><P>

You cannot use <CODE>asm</CODE> in this way in a function <EM>definition</EM>; but
you can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
before its definition and putting <CODE>asm</CODE> there, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern func () asm ("FUNC");

func (x, y)
     int x, y;
/* <small>...</small> */
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.  GCC
does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in registers.
Perhaps that will be added.

<LI>
Global register variables reserve registers throughout the program.
This may be useful in programs such as programming language
interpreters which have a couple of global variables that are accessed
very often.

Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
registers, except at the point where they are used as input or output
operands in an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement and the <CODE>asm</CODE> statement itself is
not deleted.  The compiler's data flow analysis is capable of determining
where the specified registers contain live values, and where they are
available for other uses.  Stores into local register variables may be deleted
when they appear to be dead according to dataflow analysis.  References
to local register variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.
<P>

These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the extended
<CODE>asm</CODE> feature (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC97">6.41 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</A>), if you want to write one
output of the assembler instruction directly into a particular register.
(This will work provided the register you specify fits the constraints
specified for that operand in the <CODE>asm</CODE>.)

<H3> 6.44.1 Defining Global Register Variables </H3>
<!--docid::SEC106::-->
<P>

You can define a global register variable in GNU C like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>register int *foo asm ("a5");
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>a5</CODE> is the name of the register which should be used.  Choose a
register which is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.
</P><P>

Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, so you would need to
conditionalize your program according to cpu type.  The register
<CODE>a5</CODE> would be a good choice on a 68000 for a variable of pointer
type.  On machines with register windows, be sure to choose a "global"
register that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.
</P><P>

In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <CODE>%a5</CODE>.
</P><P>

Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a register
automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should choose and
how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is evident.
</P><P>

Defining a global register variable in a certain register reserves that
register entirely for this use, at least within the current compilation.
The register will not be allocated for any other purpose in the functions
in the current compilation.  The register will not be saved and restored by
these functions.  Stores into this register are never deleted even if they
would appear to be dead, but references may be deleted or moved or
simplified.
</P><P>

It is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers, or from more than one thread of control, because the system
library routines may temporarily use the register for other things (unless
you recompile them specially for the task at hand).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1337"></A>
It is not safe for one function that uses a global register variable to
call another such function <CODE>foo</CODE> by way of a third function
<CODE>lose</CODE> that was compiled without knowledge of this variable (i.e. in a
different source file in which the variable wasn't declared).  This is
because <CODE>lose</CODE> might save the register and put some other value there.
For example, you can't expect a global register variable to be available in
the comparison-function that you pass to <CODE>qsort</CODE>, since <CODE>qsort</CODE>
might have put something else in that register.  (If you are prepared to
recompile <CODE>qsort</CODE> with the same global register variable, you can
solve this problem.)
</P><P>

If you want to recompile <CODE>qsort</CODE> or other source files which do not
actually use your global register variable, so that they will not use that
register for any other purpose, then it suffices to specify the compiler
option <SAMP>`-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP>.  You need not actually add a global
register declaration to their source code.
</P><P>

A function which can alter the value of a global register variable cannot
safely be called from a function compiled without this variable, because it
could clobber the value the caller expects to find there on return.
Therefore, the function which is the entry point into the part of the
program that uses the global register variable must explicitly save and
restore the value which belongs to its caller.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1338"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1339"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1340"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1341"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1342"></A>
On most machines, <CODE>longjmp</CODE> will restore to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the <CODE>setjmp</CODE>.  On some
machines, however, <CODE>longjmp</CODE> will not change the value of global
register variables.  To be portable, the function that called <CODE>setjmp</CODE>
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a <CODE>longjmp</CODE>.  This way, the same
thing will happen regardless of what <CODE>longjmp</CODE> does.
</P><P>

All global register variable declarations must precede all function
definitions.  If such a declaration could appear after function
definitions, the declaration would be too late to prevent the register from
being used for other purposes in the preceding functions.
</P><P>

Global register variables may not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.
</P><P>

On the SPARC, there are reports that g3 <small>...</small> g7 are suitable
registers, but certain library functions, such as <CODE>getwd</CODE>, as well
as the subroutines for division and remainder, modify g3 and g4.  g1 and
g2 are local temporaries.
</P><P>

On the 68000, a2 <small>...</small> a5 should be suitable, as should d2 <small>...</small> d7.
Of course, it will not do to use more than a few of those.

<H3> 6.44.2 Specifying Registers for Local Variables </H3>
<!--docid::SEC107::-->
<P>

You can define a local register variable with a specified register
like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>register int *foo asm ("a5");
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>a5</CODE> is the name of the register which should be used.  Note
that this is the same syntax used for defining global register
variables, but for a local variable it would appear within a function.
</P><P>

Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC97">6.41 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</A>).  Both of these things
generally require that you conditionalize your program according to
cpu type.
</P><P>

In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <CODE>%a5</CODE>.
</P><P>

Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.
</P><P>

This option does not guarantee that GCC will generate code that has
this variable in the register you specify at all times.  You may not
code an explicit reference to this register in the <EM>assembler
instruction template</EM> part of an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement and assume it will
always refer to this variable.  However, using the variable as an
<CODE>asm</CODE> <EM>operand</EM> guarantees that the specified register is used
for the operand.
</P><P>

Stores into local register variables may be deleted when they appear to be dead
according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register variables may
be deleted or moved or simplified.
</P><P>

As for global register variables, it's recommended that you choose a
register which is normally saved and restored by function calls on
your machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.  A common
pitfall is to initialize multiple call-clobbered registers with
arbitrary expressions, where a function call or library call for an
arithmetic operator will overwrite a register value from a previous
assignment, for example <CODE>r0</CODE> below:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>register int *p1 asm ("r0") = <small>...</small>;
register int *p2 asm ("r1") = <small>...</small>;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table>In those cases, a solution is to use a temporary variable for
each arbitrary expression.   See  <A HREF="gcc.html#Example of asm with clobbered asm reg">Example of asm with clobbered asm reg</A>.

<H2> 6.45 Alternate Keywords </H2>
<!--docid::SEC108::-->
<P>

<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> and the various <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> options disable certain
keywords.  This causes trouble when you want to use GNU C extensions, or
a general-purpose header file that should be usable by all programs,
including ISO C programs.  The keywords <CODE>asm</CODE>, <CODE>typeof</CODE> and
<CODE>inline</CODE> are not available in programs compiled with
<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> (although <CODE>inline</CODE> can be used in a
program compiled with <SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-std=c11'</SAMP>).  The
ISO C99 keyword
<CODE>restrict</CODE> is only available when <SAMP>`-std=gnu99'</SAMP> (which will
eventually be the default) or <SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP> (or the equivalent
<SAMP>`-std=iso9899:1999'</SAMP>), or an option for a later standard
version, is used.
</P><P>

The way to solve these problems is to put <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> at the beginning and
end of each problematical keyword.  For example, use <CODE>__asm__</CODE>
instead of <CODE>asm</CODE>, and <CODE>__inline__</CODE> instead of <CODE>inline</CODE>.
</P><P>

Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you want to
compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate keywords as
macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It looks like this:

<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> and other options cause warnings for many GNU C extensions.
You can
prevent such warnings within one expression by writing
<CODE>__extension__</CODE> before the expression.  <CODE>__extension__</CODE> has no
effect aside from this.

You can define an <CODE>enum</CODE> tag without specifying its possible values.
This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
<CODE>struct foo</CODE> without describing the elements.  A later declaration
which does specify the possible values completes the type.
</P><P>

You can't allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.

This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of

<H2> 6.47 Function Names as Strings </H2>
<!--docid::SEC110::-->
<P>

GCC provides three magic variables which hold the name of the current
function, as a string.  The first of these is <CODE>__func__</CODE>, which
is part of the C99 standard:
</P><P>

The identifier <CODE>__func__</CODE> is implicitly declared by the translator
as if, immediately following the opening brace of each function
definition, the declaration
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static const char __func__[] = "function-name";
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

appeared, where function-name is the name of the lexically-enclosing
function.  This name is the unadorned name of the function.
</P><P>

<CODE>__FUNCTION__</CODE> is another name for <CODE>__func__</CODE>.  Older
versions of GCC recognize only this name.  However, it is not
standardized.  For maximum portability, we recommend you use
<CODE>__func__</CODE>, but provide a fallback definition with the
preprocessor:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#if __STDC_VERSION__ &#60; 199901L
# if __GNUC__ &#62;= 2
#  define __func__ __FUNCTION__
# else
#  define __func__ "&#60;unknown&#62;"
# endif
#endif
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In C, <CODE>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</CODE> is yet another name for
<CODE>__func__</CODE>.  However, in C++, <CODE>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</CODE> contains
the type signature of the function as well as its bare name.  For
example, this program:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern "C" {
extern int printf (char *, ...);
}

class a {
 public:
  void sub (int i)
    {
      printf ("__FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
      printf ("__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
    }
};

int
main (void)
{
  a ax;
  ax.sub (0);
  return 0;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

gives this output:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>__FUNCTION__ = sub
__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = void a::sub(int)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

These identifiers are not preprocessor macros.  In GCC 3.3 and
earlier, in C only, <CODE>__FUNCTION__</CODE> and <CODE>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</CODE>
were treated as string literals; they could be used to initialize
<CODE>char</CODE> arrays, and they could be concatenated with other string
literals.  GCC 3.4 and later treat them as variables, like
<CODE>__func__</CODE>.  In C++, <CODE>__FUNCTION__</CODE> and
<CODE>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</CODE> have always been variables.

<H2> 6.48 Getting the Return or Frame Address of a Function </H2>
<!--docid::SEC111::-->
<P>

These functions may be used to get information about the callers of a
function.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1345"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void * <B>__builtin_return_address</B> <I>(unsigned int <VAR>level</VAR>)</I>
<DD>This function returns the return address of the current function, or of
one of its callers.  The <VAR>level</VAR> argument is number of frames to
scan up the call stack.  A value of <CODE>0</CODE> yields the return address
of the current function, a value of <CODE>1</CODE> yields the return address
of the caller of the current function, and so forth.  When inlining
the expected behavior is that the function will return the address of
the function that will be returned to.  To work around this behavior use
the <CODE>noinline</CODE> function attribute.
</P><P>

The <VAR>level</VAR> argument must be a constant integer.
</P><P>

On some machines it may be impossible to determine the return address of
any function other than the current one; in such cases, or when the top
of the stack has been reached, this function will return <CODE>0</CODE> or a
random value.  In addition, <CODE>__builtin_frame_address</CODE> may be used
to determine if the top of the stack has been reached.
</P><P>

Additional post-processing of the returned value may be needed, see
<CODE>__builtin_extract_return_address</CODE>.
</P><P>

This function should only be used with a nonzero argument for debugging
purposes.
</DL>
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1346"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void * <B>__builtin_extract_return_address</B> <I>(void *<VAR>addr</VAR>)</I>
<DD>The address as returned by <CODE>__builtin_return_address</CODE> may have to be fed
through this function to get the actual encoded address.  For example, on the
31-bit S/390 platform the highest bit has to be masked out, or on SPARC
platforms an offset has to be added for the true next instruction to be
executed.
</P><P>

If no fixup is needed, this function simply passes through <VAR>addr</VAR>.
</DL>
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1347"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void * <B>__builtin_frob_return_address</B> <I>(void *<VAR>addr</VAR>)</I>
<DD>This function does the reverse of <CODE>__builtin_extract_return_address</CODE>.
</DL>
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1348"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void * <B>__builtin_frame_address</B> <I>(unsigned int <VAR>level</VAR>)</I>
<DD>This function is similar to <CODE>__builtin_return_address</CODE>, but it
returns the address of the function frame rather than the return address
of the function.  Calling <CODE>__builtin_frame_address</CODE> with a value of
<CODE>0</CODE> yields the frame address of the current function, a value of
<CODE>1</CODE> yields the frame address of the caller of the current function,
and so forth.
</P><P>

The frame is the area on the stack which holds local variables and saved
registers.  The frame address is normally the address of the first word
pushed on to the stack by the function.  However, the exact definition
depends upon the processor and the calling convention.  If the processor
has a dedicated frame pointer register, and the function has a frame,
then <CODE>__builtin_frame_address</CODE> will return the value of the frame
pointer register.
</P><P>

On some machines it may be impossible to determine the frame address of
any function other than the current one; in such cases, or when the top
of the stack has been reached, this function will return <CODE>0</CODE> if
the first frame pointer is properly initialized by the startup code.
</P><P>

<H2> 6.49 Using vector instructions through built-in functions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC112::-->
<P>

On some targets, the instruction set contains SIMD vector instructions that
operate on multiple values contained in one large register at the same time.
For example, on the i386 the MMX, 3DNow! and SSE extensions can be used
this way.
</P><P>

The first step in using these extensions is to provide the necessary data
types.  This should be done using an appropriate <CODE>typedef</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>int</CODE> type specifies the base type, while the attribute specifies
the vector size for the variable, measured in bytes.  For example, the
declaration above causes the compiler to set the mode for the <CODE>v4si</CODE>
type to be 16 bytes wide and divided into <CODE>int</CODE> sized units.  For
a 32-bit <CODE>int</CODE> this means a vector of 4 units of 4 bytes, and the
corresponding mode of <CODE>foo</CODE> will be <FONT SIZE="-1">V4SI</FONT>.
</P><P>

The <CODE>vector_size</CODE> attribute is only applicable to integral and
float scalars, although arrays, pointers, and function return values
are allowed in conjunction with this construct.
</P><P>

All the basic integer types can be used as base types, both as signed
and as unsigned: <CODE>char</CODE>, <CODE>short</CODE>, <CODE>int</CODE>, <CODE>long</CODE>,
<CODE>long long</CODE>.  In addition, <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>double</CODE> can be
used to build floating-point vector types.
</P><P>

Specifying a combination that is not valid for the current architecture
will cause GCC to synthesize the instructions using a narrower mode.
For example, if you specify a variable of type <CODE>V4SI</CODE> and your
architecture does not allow for this specific SIMD type, GCC will
produce code that uses 4 <CODE>SIs</CODE>.
</P><P>

The types defined in this manner can be used with a subset of normal C
operations.  Currently, GCC will allow using the following operators
on these types: <CODE>+, -, *, /, unary minus, ^, |, &#38;, ~, %</CODE>.
</P><P>

The operations behave like C++ <CODE>valarrays</CODE>.  Addition is defined as
the addition of the corresponding elements of the operands.  For
example, in the code below, each of the 4 elements in <VAR>a</VAR> will be
added to the corresponding 4 elements in <VAR>b</VAR> and the resulting
vector will be stored in <VAR>c</VAR>.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

v4si a, b, c;

c = a + b;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Subtraction, multiplication, division, and the logical operations
operate in a similar manner.  Likewise, the result of using the unary
minus or complement operators on a vector type is a vector whose
elements are the negative or complemented values of the corresponding
elements in the operand.
</P><P>

In C it is possible to use shifting operators <CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE> on
integer-type vectors. The operation is defined as following: <CODE>{a0,
a1, <small>...</small>, an} &#62;&#62; {b0, b1, <small>...</small>, bn} == {a0 &#62;&#62; b0, a1 &#62;&#62; b1,
<small>...</small>, an &#62;&#62; bn}</CODE>. Vector operands must have the same number of
elements. 
</P><P>

For the convenience in C it is allowed to use a binary vector operation
where one operand is a scalar. In that case the compiler will transform
the scalar operand into a vector where each element is the scalar from
the operation. The transformation will happen only if the scalar could be
safely converted to the vector-element type.
Consider the following code.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

v4si a, b, c;
long l;

a = b + 1;    /* a = b + {1,1,1,1}; */
a = 2 * b;    /* a = {2,2,2,2} * b; */

a = l + a;    /* Error, cannot convert long to int. */
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In C vectors can be subscripted as if the vector were an array with
the same number of elements and base type.  Out of bound accesses
invoke undefined behavior at runtime.  Warnings for out of bound
accesses for vector subscription can be enabled with
<SAMP>`-Warray-bounds'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

In GNU C vector comparison is supported within standard comparison
operators: <CODE>==, !=, &#60;, &#60;=, &#62;, &#62;=</CODE>. Comparison operands can be
vector expressions of integer-type or real-type. Comparison between
integer-type vectors and real-type vectors are not supported.  The
result of the comparison is a vector of the same width and number of
elements as the comparison operands with a signed integral element
type.
</P><P>

Vectors are compared element-wise producing 0 when comparison is false
and -1 (constant of the appropriate type where all bits are set)
otherwise. Consider the following example.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

v4si a = {1,2,3,4};
v4si b = {3,2,1,4};
v4si c;

c = a &#62;  b;     /* The result would be {0, 0,-1, 0}  */
c = a == b;     /* The result would be {0,-1, 0,-1}  */
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Vector shuffling is available using functions
<CODE>__builtin_shuffle (vec, mask)</CODE> and
<CODE>__builtin_shuffle (vec0, vec1, mask)</CODE>.
Both functions construct a permutation of elements from one or two
vectors and return a vector of the same type as the input vector(s).
The <VAR>mask</VAR> is an integral vector with the same width (<VAR>W</VAR>)
and element count (<VAR>N</VAR>) as the output vector.
</P><P>

The elements of the input vectors are numbered in memory ordering of
<VAR>vec0</VAR> beginning at 0 and <VAR>vec1</VAR> beginning at <VAR>N</VAR>.  The
elements of <VAR>mask</VAR> are considered modulo <VAR>N</VAR> in the single-operand
case and modulo <EM>2*<VAR>N</VAR></EM> in the two-operand case.
</P><P>

Consider the following example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

v4si a = {1,2,3,4};
v4si b = {5,6,7,8};
v4si mask1 = {0,1,1,3};
v4si mask2 = {0,4,2,5};
v4si res;

res = __builtin_shuffle (a, mask1);       /* res is {1,2,2,4}  */
res = __builtin_shuffle (a, b, mask2);    /* res is {1,5,3,6}  */
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that <CODE>__builtin_shuffle</CODE> is intentionally semantically
compatible with the OpenCL <CODE>shuffle</CODE> and <CODE>shuffle2</CODE> functions.
</P><P>

You can declare variables and use them in function calls and returns, as
well as in assignments and some casts.  You can specify a vector type as
a return type for a function.  Vector types can also be used as function
arguments.  It is possible to cast from one vector type to another,
provided they are of the same size (in fact, you can also cast vectors
to and from other datatypes of the same size).
</P><P>

You cannot operate between vectors of different lengths or different
signedness without a cast.

<H2> 6.51 Legacy __sync built-in functions for atomic memory access </H2>
<!--docid::SEC114::-->
<P>

The following builtins are intended to be compatible with those described
in the <CITE>Intel Itanium Processor-specific Application Binary Interface</CITE>,
section 7.4.  As such, they depart from the normal GCC practice of using
the "__builtin_" prefix, and further that they are overloaded such that
they work on multiple types.
</P><P>

The definition given in the Intel documentation allows only for the use of
the types <CODE>int</CODE>, <CODE>long</CODE>, <CODE>long long</CODE> as well as their unsigned
counterparts.  GCC will allow any integral scalar or pointer type that is
1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes in length.
</P><P>

Not all operations are supported by all target processors.  If a particular
operation cannot be implemented on the target processor, a warning will be
generated and a call an external function will be generated.  The external
function will carry the same name as the builtin, with an additional suffix
<SAMP>`_<VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP> where <VAR>n</VAR> is the size of the data type.
</P><P>

In most cases, these builtins are considered a <EM>full barrier</EM>.  That is,
no memory operand will be moved across the operation, either forward or
backward.  Further, instructions will be issued as necessary to prevent the
processor from speculating loads across the operation and from queuing stores
after the operation.
</P><P>

All of the routines are described in the Intel documentation to take
"an optional list of variables protected by the memory barrier".  It's
not clear what is meant by that; it could mean that <EM>only</EM> the
following variables are protected, or it could mean that these variables
should in addition be protected.  At present GCC ignores this list and
protects all variables which are globally accessible.  If in the future
we make some use of this list, an empty list will continue to mean all
globally accessible variables.

<H2> 6.52 Built-in functions for memory model aware atomic operations </H2>
<!--docid::SEC115::-->
<P>

The following built-in functions approximately match the requirements for
C++11 memory model. Many are similar to the <SAMP>`__sync'</SAMP> prefixed built-in
functions, but all also have a memory model parameter.  These are all
identified by being prefixed with <SAMP>`__atomic'</SAMP>, and most are overloaded
such that they work with multiple types.
</P><P>

GCC will allow any integral scalar or pointer type that is 1, 2, 4, or 8
bytes in length. 16-byte integral types are also allowed if
<SAMP>`__int128'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC62">6.8 128-bits integers</A>) is supported by the architecture.
</P><P>

Target architectures are encouraged to provide their own patterns for
each of these built-in functions.  If no target is provided, the original 
non-memory model set of <SAMP>`__sync'</SAMP> atomic built-in functions will be
utilized, along with any required synchronization fences surrounding it in
order to achieve the proper behaviour.  Execution in this case is subject
to the same restrictions as those built-in functions.
</P><P>

If there is no pattern or mechanism to provide a lock free instruction
sequence, a call is made to an external routine with the same parameters
to be resolved at runtime.
</P><P>

The four non-arithmetic functions (load, store, exchange, and 
compare_exchange) all have a generic version as well.  This generic
version will work on any data type.  If the data type size maps to one
of the integral sizes which may have lock free support, the generic
version will utilize the lock free built-in function.  Otherwise an
external call is left to be resolved at runtime.  This external call will
be the same format with the addition of a <SAMP>`size_t'</SAMP> parameter inserted
as the first parameter indicating the size of the object being pointed to.
All objects must be the same size.
</P><P>

There are 6 different memory models which can be specified.  These map
to the same names in the C++11 standard.  Refer there or to the
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM/AtomicSync">GCC wiki on
atomic synchronization</A> for more detailed definitions.  These memory
models integrate both barriers to code motion as well as synchronization
requirements with other threads. These are listed in approximately
ascending order of strength.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>__ATOMIC_RELAXED</CODE>
<DD>No barriers or synchronization.
<DT><CODE>__ATOMIC_CONSUME</CODE>
<DD>Data dependency only for both barrier and synchronization with another

</DL>
<P>

When implementing patterns for these built-in functions , the memory model
parameter can be ignored as long as the pattern implements the most
restrictive <CODE>__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST</CODE> model.  Any of the other memory models
will execute correctly with this memory model but they may not execute as
efficiently as they could with a more appropriate implemention of the
relaxed requirements.
</P><P>

Note that the C++11 standard allows for the memory model parameter to be
determined at runtime rather than at compile time.  These built-in
functions will map any runtime value to <CODE>__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST</CODE> rather
than invoke a runtime library call or inline a switch statement.  This is
standard compliant, safe, and the simplest approach for now.
</P><P>

The memory model parameter is a signed int, but only the lower 8 bits are
reserved for the memory model.  The remainder of the signed int is reserved
for future use and should be 0.  Use of the predefined atomic values will
ensure proper usage.

GCC implements a limited buffer overflow protection mechanism
that can prevent some buffer overflow attacks.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1392"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> size_t <B>__builtin_object_size</B> <I>(void * <VAR>ptr</VAR>, int <VAR>type</VAR>)</I>
<DD>is a built-in construct that returns a constant number of bytes from
<VAR>ptr</VAR> to the end of the object <VAR>ptr</VAR> pointer points to
(if known at compile time).  <CODE>__builtin_object_size</CODE> never evaluates
its arguments for side-effects.  If there are any side-effects in them, it
returns <CODE>(size_t) -1</CODE> for <VAR>type</VAR> 0 or 1 and <CODE>(size_t) 0</CODE>
for <VAR>type</VAR> 2 or 3.  If there are multiple objects <VAR>ptr</VAR> can
point to and all of them are known at compile time, the returned number
is the maximum of remaining byte counts in those objects if <VAR>type</VAR> &#38; 2 is
0 and minimum if nonzero.  If it is not possible to determine which objects
<VAR>ptr</VAR> points to at compile time, <CODE>__builtin_object_size</CODE> should
return <CODE>(size_t) -1</CODE> for <VAR>type</VAR> 0 or 1 and <CODE>(size_t) 0</CODE>
for <VAR>type</VAR> 2 or 3.
</P><P>

<VAR>type</VAR> is an integer constant from 0 to 3.  If the least significant
bit is clear, objects are whole variables, if it is set, a closest
surrounding subobject is considered the object a pointer points to.
The second bit determines if maximum or minimum of remaining bytes
is computed.

There are built-in functions added for many common string operation
functions, e.g., for <CODE>memcpy</CODE> <CODE>__builtin___memcpy_chk</CODE>
built-in is provided.  This built-in has an additional last argument,
which is the number of bytes remaining in object the <VAR>dest</VAR>
argument points to or <CODE>(size_t) -1</CODE> if the size is not known.
</P><P>

The built-in functions are optimized into the normal string functions
like <CODE>memcpy</CODE> if the last argument is <CODE>(size_t) -1</CODE> or if
it is known at compile time that the destination object will not
be overflown.  If the compiler can determine at compile time the
object will be always overflown, it issues a warning.
</P><P>

The intended use can be e.g.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#undef memcpy
#define bos0(dest) __builtin_object_size (dest, 0)
#define memcpy(dest, src, n) \
  __builtin___memcpy_chk (dest, src, n, bos0 (dest))

char *volatile p;
char buf[10];
/* It is unknown what object p points to, so this is optimized
   into plain memcpy - no checking is possible.  */
memcpy (p, "abcde", n);
/* Destination is known and length too.  It is known at compile
   time there will be no overflow.  */
memcpy (&#38;buf[5], "abcde", 5);
/* Destination is known, but the length is not known at compile time.
   This will result in __memcpy_chk call that can check for overflow
   at runtime.  */
memcpy (&#38;buf[5], "abcde", n);
/* Destination is known and it is known at compile time there will
   be overflow.  There will be a warning and __memcpy_chk call that
   will abort the program at runtime.  */
memcpy (&#38;buf[6], "abcde", 5);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Such built-in functions are provided for <CODE>memcpy</CODE>, <CODE>mempcpy</CODE>,
<CODE>memmove</CODE>, <CODE>memset</CODE>, <CODE>strcpy</CODE>, <CODE>stpcpy</CODE>, <CODE>strncpy</CODE>,
<CODE>strcat</CODE> and <CODE>strncat</CODE>.
</P><P>

There are also checking built-in functions for formatted output functions.
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int __builtin___sprintf_chk (char *s, int flag, size_t os, const char *fmt, ...);
int __builtin___snprintf_chk (char *s, size_t maxlen, int flag, size_t os,
                              const char *fmt, ...);
int __builtin___vsprintf_chk (char *s, int flag, size_t os, const char *fmt,
                              va_list ap);
int __builtin___vsnprintf_chk (char *s, size_t maxlen, int flag, size_t os,
                               const char *fmt, va_list ap);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The added <VAR>flag</VAR> argument is passed unchanged to <CODE>__sprintf_chk</CODE>
etc. functions and can contain implementation specific flags on what
additional security measures the checking function might take, such as
handling <CODE>%n</CODE> differently.
</P><P>

The <VAR>os</VAR> argument is the object size <VAR>s</VAR> points to, like in the
other built-in functions.  There is a small difference in the behavior
though, if <VAR>os</VAR> is <CODE>(size_t) -1</CODE>, the built-in functions are
optimized into the non-checking functions only if <VAR>flag</VAR> is 0, otherwise
the checking function is called with <VAR>os</VAR> argument set to
<CODE>(size_t) -1</CODE>.
</P><P>

In addition to this, there are checking built-in functions
<CODE>__builtin___printf_chk</CODE>, <CODE>__builtin___vprintf_chk</CODE>,
<CODE>__builtin___fprintf_chk</CODE> and <CODE>__builtin___vfprintf_chk</CODE>.
These have just one additional argument, <VAR>flag</VAR>, right before
format string <VAR>fmt</VAR>.  If the compiler is able to optimize them to
<CODE>fputc</CODE> etc. functions, it will, otherwise the checking function
should be called and the <VAR>flag</VAR> argument passed to it.

You can use the built-in function <CODE>__builtin_types_compatible_p</CODE> to
determine whether two types are the same.
</P><P>

This built-in function returns 1 if the unqualified versions of the

compatible, 0 otherwise.  The result of this built-in function can be
used in integer constant expressions.

The type <CODE>int[]</CODE> and <CODE>int[5]</CODE> are compatible.  On the other
hand, <CODE>int</CODE> and <CODE>char *</CODE> are not compatible, even if the size
of their types, on the particular architecture are the same.  Also, the
amount of pointer indirection is taken into account when determining
similarity.  Consequently, <CODE>short *</CODE> is not similar to
<CODE>short **</CODE>.  Furthermore, two types that are typedefed are
considered compatible if their underlying types are compatible.
</P><P>

An <CODE>enum</CODE> type is not considered to be compatible with another

<DD></P><P>

You can use the built-in function <CODE>__builtin_choose_expr</CODE> to
evaluate code depending on the value of a constant expression.  This
built-in function returns <VAR>exp1</VAR> if <VAR>const_exp</VAR>, which is an

</P><P>

This built-in function is analogous to the <SAMP>`? :'</SAMP> operator in C,
except that the expression returned has its type unaltered by promotion
rules.  Also, the built-in function does not evaluate the expression
that was not chosen.  For example, if <VAR>const_exp</VAR> evaluates to true,
<VAR>exp2</VAR> is not evaluated even if it has side-effects.
</P><P>

This built-in function can return an lvalue if the chosen argument is an
lvalue.

If <VAR>exp1</VAR> is returned, the return type is the same as <VAR>exp1</VAR>'s

<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> int <B>__builtin_constant_p</B> <I>(<VAR>exp</VAR>)</I>
<DD>You can use the built-in function <CODE>__builtin_constant_p</CODE> to
determine if a value is known to be constant at compile-time and hence
that GCC can perform constant-folding on expressions involving that
value.  The argument of the function is the value to test.  The function
returns the integer 1 if the argument is known to be a compile-time
constant and 0 if it is not known to be a compile-time constant.  A
return of 0 does not indicate that the value is <EM>not</EM> a constant,
but merely that GCC cannot prove it is a constant with the specified
value of the <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

You would typically use this function in an embedded application where
memory was a critical resource.  If you have some complex calculation,
you may want it to be folded if it involves constants, but need to call
a function if it does not.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define Scale_Value(X)      \
  (__builtin_constant_p (X) \
  ? ((X) * SCALE + OFFSET) : Scale (X))
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You may use this built-in function in either a macro or an inline
function.  However, if you use it in an inlined function and pass an
argument of the function as the argument to the built-in, GCC will
never return 1 when you call the inline function with a string constant
or compound literal (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC81">6.25 Compound Literals</A>) and will not return 1
when you pass a constant numeric value to the inline function unless you
specify the <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

You may also use <CODE>__builtin_constant_p</CODE> in initializers for static
data.  For instance, you can write
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>static const int table[] = {
   __builtin_constant_p (EXPRESSION) ? (EXPRESSION) : -1,
   /* <small>...</small> */
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is an acceptable initializer even if <VAR>EXPRESSION</VAR> is not a
constant expression, including the case where
<CODE>__builtin_constant_p</CODE> returns 1 because <VAR>EXPRESSION</VAR> can be
folded to a constant but <VAR>EXPRESSION</VAR> contains operands that would
not otherwise be permitted in a static initializer (for example,
<CODE>0 &#38;&#38; foo ()</CODE>).  GCC must be more conservative about evaluating the
built-in in this case, because it has no opportunity to perform
optimization.
</P><P>

Previous versions of GCC did not accept this built-in in data
initializers.  The earliest version where it is completely safe is
3.0.1.

<DD><A NAME="IDX1401"></A>
You may use <CODE>__builtin_expect</CODE> to provide the compiler with
branch prediction information.  In general, you should prefer to
use actual profile feedback for this (<SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>), as
programmers are notoriously bad at predicting how their programs
actually perform.  However, there are applications in which this
data is hard to collect.
</P><P>

The return value is the value of <VAR>exp</VAR>, which should be an integral
expression.  The semantics of the built-in are that it is expected that
<VAR>exp</VAR> == <VAR>c</VAR>.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>if (__builtin_expect (x, 0))
  foo ();
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

would indicate that we do not expect to call <CODE>foo</CODE>, since
we expect <CODE>x</CODE> to be zero.  Since you are limited to integral
expressions for <VAR>exp</VAR>, you should use constructions such as
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>if (__builtin_expect (ptr != NULL, 1))

<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void <B>__builtin_trap</B> <I>(void)</I>
<DD>This function causes the program to exit abnormally.  GCC implements
this function by using a target-dependent mechanism (such as
intentionally executing an illegal instruction) or by calling

<DD>If control flow reaches the point of the <CODE>__builtin_unreachable</CODE>,
the program is undefined.  It is useful in situations where the
compiler cannot deduce the unreachability of the code.
</P><P>

One such case is immediately following an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement that
will either never terminate, or one that transfers control elsewhere
and never returns.  In this example, without the
<CODE>__builtin_unreachable</CODE>, GCC would issue a warning that control
reaches the end of a non-void function.  It would also generate code
to return after the <CODE>asm</CODE>.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int f (int c, int v)

Because the <CODE>asm</CODE> statement unconditionally transfers control out
of the function, control will never reach the end of the function
body.  The <CODE>__builtin_unreachable</CODE> is in fact unreachable and
communicates this fact to the compiler.
</P><P>

Another use for <CODE>__builtin_unreachable</CODE> is following a call a
function that never returns but that is not declared

<CODE>__builtin___clear_cache</CODE> has no effect.  Otherwise either
instructions are emitted in-line to clear the instruction cache or a
call to the <CODE>__clear_cache</CODE> function in libgcc is made.

<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U> void <B>__builtin_prefetch</B> <I>(const void *<VAR>addr</VAR>, ...)</I>
<DD>This function is used to minimize cache-miss latency by moving data into
a cache before it is accessed.
You can insert calls to <CODE>__builtin_prefetch</CODE> into code for which
you know addresses of data in memory that is likely to be accessed soon.
If the target supports them, data prefetch instructions will be generated.
If the prefetch is done early enough before the access then the data will
be in the cache by the time it is accessed.
</P><P>

The value of <VAR>addr</VAR> is the address of the memory to prefetch.
There are two optional arguments, <VAR>rw</VAR> and <VAR>locality</VAR>.
The value of <VAR>rw</VAR> is a compile-time constant one or zero; one
means that the prefetch is preparing for a write to the memory address
and zero, the default, means that the prefetch is preparing for a read.
The value <VAR>locality</VAR> must be a compile-time constant integer between
zero and three.  A value of zero means that the data has no temporal
locality, so it need not be left in the cache after the access.  A value
of three means that the data has a high degree of temporal locality and
should be left in all levels of cache possible.  Values of one and two
mean, respectively, a low or moderate degree of temporal locality.  The
default is three.

  }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Data prefetch does not generate faults if <VAR>addr</VAR> is invalid, but
the address expression itself must be valid.  For example, a prefetch
of <CODE>p-&#62;next</CODE> will not fault if <CODE>p-&#62;next</CODE> is not a valid
address, but evaluation will fault if <CODE>p</CODE> is not a valid address.
</P><P>

If the target does not support data prefetch, the address expression
is evaluated if it includes side effects but no other code is generated
and GCC does not issue a warning.

forced to be a quiet NaN.

Overrides the command-line option <CODE>-memregs=</CODE> for the current

file, and mixing different memregs values in different objects may
make them incompatible.  This pragma is useful when a

<P>

For compatibility with the Solaris and Tru64 UNIX system headers, GCC
supports two <CODE>#pragma</CODE> directives which change the name used in
assembly for a given declaration.  <CODE>#pragma extern_prefix</CODE> is only
available on platforms whose system headers need it. To get this effect
on all platforms supported by GCC, use the asm labels extension (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC104">6.43 Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code</A>).
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>redefine_extname <VAR>oldname</VAR> <VAR>newname</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1473"></A>
<P>

This pragma gives the C function <VAR>oldname</VAR> the assembly symbol
<VAR>newname</VAR>.  The preprocessor macro <CODE>__PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME</CODE>
will be defined if this pragma is available (currently on all platforms).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>extern_prefix <VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1474"></A>
<P>

This pragma causes all subsequent external function and variable
declarations to have <VAR>string</VAR> prepended to their assembly symbols.
This effect may be terminated with another <CODE>extern_prefix</CODE> pragma
whose argument is an empty string.  The preprocessor macro
<CODE>__PRAGMA_EXTERN_PREFIX</CODE> will be defined if this pragma is
available (currently only on Tru64 UNIX).
</DL>
<P>

These pragmas and the asm labels extension interact in a complicated
manner.  Here are some corner cases you may want to be aware of.
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>Both pragmas silently apply only to declarations with external
linkage.  Asm labels do not have this restriction.
<P>

<LI>In C++, both pragmas silently apply only to declarations with
"C" linkage.  Again, asm labels do not have this restriction.
<P>

<LI>If any of the three ways of changing the assembly name of a
declaration is applied to a declaration whose assembly name has
already been determined (either by a previous use of one of these
features, or because the compiler needed the assembly name in order to
generate code), and the new name is different, a warning issues and
the name does not change.
<P>

<LI>The <VAR>oldname</VAR> used by <CODE>#pragma redefine_extname</CODE> is
always the C-language name.
<P>

<LI>If <CODE>#pragma extern_prefix</CODE> is in effect, and a declaration
occurs with an asm label attached, the prefix is silently ignored for
that declaration.
<P>

<LI>If <CODE>#pragma extern_prefix</CODE> and <CODE>#pragma redefine_extname</CODE>
apply to the same declaration, whichever triggered first wins, and a
warning issues if they contradict each other.  (We would like to have
<CODE>#pragma redefine_extname</CODE> always win, for consistency with asm
labels, but if <CODE>#pragma extern_prefix</CODE> triggers first we have no
way of knowing that that happened.)

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports a
set of <CODE>#pragma</CODE> directives which change the maximum alignment of
members of structures (other than zero-width bitfields), unions, and
classes subsequently defined. The <VAR>n</VAR> value below always is required
to be a small power of two and specifies the new alignment in bytes.
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI><CODE>#pragma pack(<VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE> simply sets the new alignment.

<SAMP>`-fpack-struct[=<VAR>n</VAR>]'</SAMP> see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC31">3.18 Options for Code Generation Conventions</A>).
<LI><CODE>#pragma pack(push[,<VAR>n</VAR>])</CODE> pushes the current alignment
setting on an internal stack and then optionally sets the new alignment.
<LI><CODE>#pragma pack(pop)</CODE> restores the alignment setting to the one
saved at the top of the internal stack (and removes that stack entry).
Note that <CODE>#pragma pack([<VAR>n</VAR>])</CODE> does not influence this internal
stack; thus it is possible to have <CODE>#pragma pack(push)</CODE> followed by
multiple <CODE>#pragma pack(<VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE> instances and finalized by a single
<CODE>#pragma pack(pop)</CODE>.

GCC allows the user to selectively enable or disable certain types of
diagnostics, and change the kind of the diagnostic.  For example, a
project's policy might require that all sources compile with
<SAMP>`-Werror'</SAMP> but certain files might have exceptions allowing
specific types of warnings.  Or, a project might selectively enable
diagnostics and treat them as errors depending on which preprocessor
macros are defined.

controlled by <SAMP>`-W<small>...</small>'</SAMP>) can be controlled, and not all of them.
Use <SAMP>`-fdiagnostics-show-option'</SAMP> to determine which diagnostics
are controllable and which option controls them.
</P><P>

<VAR>kind</VAR> is <SAMP>`error'</SAMP> to treat this diagnostic as an error,
<SAMP>`warning'</SAMP> to treat it like a warning (even if <SAMP>`-Werror'</SAMP> is

Note that these pragmas override any command-line options.  GCC keeps
track of the location of each pragma, and issues diagnostics according

<H3> 6.56.7 Push/Pop Macro Pragmas </H3>
<!--docid::SEC127::-->
<P>

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports
<SAMP>`#pragma push_macro(<VAR>"macro_name"</VAR>)'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`#pragma pop_macro(<VAR>"macro_name"</VAR>)'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>#pragma push_macro(<VAR>"macro_name"</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1479"></A>
This pragma saves the value of the macro named as <VAR>macro_name</VAR> to
the top of the stack for this macro.
<P>

<DT><CODE>#pragma pop_macro(<VAR>"macro_name"</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1480"></A>
This pragma sets the value of the macro named as <VAR>macro_name</VAR> to
the value on top of the stack for this macro. If the stack for
<VAR>macro_name</VAR> is empty, the value of the macro remains unchanged.
</DL>
<P>

For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define X  1
#pragma push_macro("X")
#undef X
#define X -1
#pragma pop_macro("X")
int x [X];
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, the definition of X as 1 is saved by <CODE>#pragma
push_macro</CODE> and restored by <CODE>#pragma pop_macro</CODE>.

This pragma allows you to set global optimization options for functions
defined later in the source file.  One or more strings can be
specified.  Each function that is defined after this point will be as
if <CODE>attribute((optimize("STRING")))</CODE> was specified for that
function.  The parenthesis around the options is optional.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>, for more information about the

<H2> 6.57 Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC129::-->
<P>

As permitted by ISO C11 and for compatibility with other compilers,
GCC allows you to define
a structure or union that contains, as fields, structures and unions
without names.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct {
  int a;
  union {
    int b;
    float c;
  };
  int d;
} foo;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, the user would be able to access members of the unnamed
union with code like <SAMP>`foo.b'</SAMP>.  Note that only unnamed structs and
unions are allowed, you may not have, for example, an unnamed
<CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

You must never create such structures that cause ambiguous field definitions.
For example, this structure:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct {
  int a;
  struct {
    int a;
  };
} foo;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is ambiguous which <CODE>a</CODE> is being referred to with <SAMP>`foo.a'</SAMP>.
The compiler gives errors for such constructs.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1485"></A>
Unless <SAMP>`-fms-extensions'</SAMP> is used, the unnamed field must be a
structure or union definition without a tag (for example, <SAMP>`struct
{ int a; };'</SAMP>).  If <SAMP>`-fms-extensions'</SAMP> is used, the field may
also be a definition with a tag such as <SAMP>`struct foo { int a;
};'</SAMP>, a reference to a previously defined structure or union such as
<SAMP>`struct foo;'</SAMP>, or a reference to a <CODE>typedef</CODE> name for a
previously defined structure or union type.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1486"></A>
The option <SAMP>`-fplan9-extensions'</SAMP> enables
<SAMP>`-fms-extensions'</SAMP> as well as two other extensions.  First, a
pointer to a structure is automatically converted to a pointer to an
anonymous field for assignments and function calls.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct s1 { int a; };
struct s2 { struct s1; };
extern void f1 (struct s1 *);
void f2 (struct s2 *p) { f1 (p); }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In the call to <CODE>f1</CODE> inside <CODE>f2</CODE>, the pointer <CODE>p</CODE> is
converted into a pointer to the anonymous field.
</P><P>

Second, when the type of an anonymous field is a <CODE>typedef</CODE> for a
<CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE>, code may refer to the field using the
name of the <CODE>typedef</CODE>.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef struct { int a; } s1;
struct s2 { s1; };
s1 f1 (struct s2 *p) { return p-&#62;s1; }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

These usages are only permitted when they are not ambiguous.

<H2> 6.58 Thread-Local Storage </H2>
<!--docid::SEC130::-->
<P>

Thread-local storage (<FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT>) is a mechanism by which variables
are allocated such that there is one instance of the variable per extant
thread.  The run-time model GCC uses to implement this originates
in the IA-64 processor-specific ABI, but has since been migrated
to other processors as well.  It requires significant support from
the linker (<CODE>ld</CODE>), dynamic linker (<CODE>ld.so</CODE>), and
system libraries (<TT>`libc.so'</TT> and <TT>`libpthread.so'</TT>), so it
is not available everywhere.
</P><P>

At the user level, the extension is visible with a new storage
class keyword: <CODE>__thread</CODE>.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>__thread int i;
extern __thread struct state s;
static __thread char *p;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>__thread</CODE> specifier may be used alone, with the <CODE>extern</CODE>
or <CODE>static</CODE> specifiers, but with no other storage class specifier.
When used with <CODE>extern</CODE> or <CODE>static</CODE>, <CODE>__thread</CODE> must appear
immediately after the other storage class specifier.
</P><P>

The <CODE>__thread</CODE> specifier may be applied to any global, file-scoped
static, function-scoped static, or static data member of a class.  It may
not be applied to block-scoped automatic or non-static data member.
</P><P>

When the address-of operator is applied to a thread-local variable, it is
evaluated at run-time and returns the address of the current thread's
instance of that variable.  An address so obtained may be used by any
thread.  When a thread terminates, any pointers to thread-local variables
in that thread become invalid.
</P><P>

No static initialization may refer to the address of a thread-local variable.
</P><P>

In C++, if an initializer is present for a thread-local variable, it must
be a <VAR>constant-expression</VAR>, as defined in 5.19.2 of the ANSI/ISO C++
standard.
</P><P>

See <A HREF="http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf">ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage</A> for a detailed explanation of
the four thread-local storage addressing models, and how the run-time
is expected to function.

<SAMP>`0B'</SAMP>.  This is particularly useful in environments that operate a
lot on the bit-level (like microcontrollers).

i =     0x2a;
i =      052;
i = 0b101010;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The type of these constants follows the same rules as for octal or
hexadecimal integer constants, so suffixes like <SAMP>`L'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`UL'</SAMP>
can be applied.

<!--docid::SEC134::-->
<P>

The GNU compiler provides these extensions to the C++ language (and you
can also use most of the C language extensions in your C++ programs).  If you
want to write code that checks whether these features are available, you can
test for the GNU compiler the same way as for C programs: check for a
predefined macro <CODE>__GNUC__</CODE>.  You can also use <CODE>__GNUG__</CODE> to
test specifically for GNU C++ (see section `Predefined Macros' in <CITE>The GNU C Preprocessor</CITE>).

<H2> 7.1 When is a Volatile C++ Object Accessed? </H2>
<!--docid::SEC135::-->
<P>

The C++ standard differs from the C standard in its treatment of
volatile objects.  It fails to specify what constitutes a volatile
access, except to say that C++ should behave in a similar manner to C
with respect to volatiles, where possible.  However, the different
lvalueness of expressions between C and C++ complicate the behavior.
G++ behaves the same as GCC for volatile access, See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC54">Volatiles</A>, for a description of GCC's behavior.
</P><P>

The C and C++ language specifications differ when an object is
accessed in a void context:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>volatile int *src = <VAR>somevalue</VAR>;
*src;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The C++ standard specifies that such expressions do not undergo lvalue
to rvalue conversion, and that the type of the dereferenced object may
be incomplete.  The C++ standard does not specify explicitly that it
is lvalue to rvalue conversion which is responsible for causing an
access.  There is reason to believe that it is, because otherwise
certain simple expressions become undefined.  However, because it
would surprise most programmers, G++ treats dereferencing a pointer to
volatile object of complete type as GCC would do for an equivalent
type in C.  When the object has incomplete type, G++ issues a
warning; if you wish to force an error, you must force a conversion to
rvalue with, for instance, a static cast.
</P><P>

When using a reference to volatile, G++ does not treat equivalent
expressions as accesses to volatiles, but instead issues a warning that
no volatile is accessed.  The rationale for this is that otherwise it
becomes difficult to determine where volatile access occur, and not
possible to ignore the return value from functions returning volatile
references.  Again, if you wish to force a read, cast the reference to
an rvalue.
</P><P>

G++ implements the same behavior as GCC does when assigning to a
volatile object -- there is no reread of the assigned-to object, the
assigned rvalue is reused.  Note that in C++ assignment expressions
are lvalues, and if used as an lvalue, the volatile object will be
referred to.  For instance, <VAR>vref</VAR> will refer to <VAR>vobj</VAR>, as
expected, in the following example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>volatile int vobj;
volatile int &#38;vref = vobj = <VAR>something</VAR>;

<H2> 7.2 Restricting Pointer Aliasing </H2>
<!--docid::SEC136::-->
<P>

As with the C front end, G++ understands the C99 feature of restricted pointers,
specified with the <CODE>__restrict__</CODE>, or <CODE>__restrict</CODE> type
qualifier.  Because you cannot compile C++ by specifying the <SAMP>`-std=c99'</SAMP>
language flag, <CODE>restrict</CODE> is not a keyword in C++.
</P><P>

In addition to allowing restricted pointers, you can specify restricted
references, which indicate that the reference is not aliased in the local
context.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void fn (int *__restrict__ rptr, int &#38;__restrict__ rref)
{
  /* <small>...</small> */
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In the body of <CODE>fn</CODE>, <VAR>rptr</VAR> points to an unaliased integer and
<VAR>rref</VAR> refers to a (different) unaliased integer.
</P><P>

You may also specify whether a member function's <VAR>this</VAR> pointer is
unaliased by using <CODE>__restrict__</CODE> as a member function qualifier.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void T::fn () __restrict__
{
  /* <small>...</small> */
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Within the body of <CODE>T::fn</CODE>, <VAR>this</VAR> will have the effective
definition <CODE>T *__restrict__ const this</CODE>.  Notice that the
interpretation of a <CODE>__restrict__</CODE> member function qualifier is
different to that of <CODE>const</CODE> or <CODE>volatile</CODE> qualifier, in that it
is applied to the pointer rather than the object.  This is consistent with
other compilers which implement restricted pointers.
</P><P>

As with all outermost parameter qualifiers, <CODE>__restrict__</CODE> is
ignored in function definition matching.  This means you only need to
specify <CODE>__restrict__</CODE> in a function definition, rather than
in a function prototype as well.

<H2> 7.3 Vague Linkage </H2>
<!--docid::SEC137::-->
<P>

There are several constructs in C++ which require space in the object
file but are not clearly tied to a single translation unit.  We say that
these constructs have "vague linkage".  Typically such constructs are
emitted wherever they are needed, though sometimes we can be more
clever.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Inline Functions
<DD>Inline functions are typically defined in a header file which can be
included in many different compilations.  Hopefully they can usually be
inlined, but sometimes an out-of-line copy is necessary, if the address
of the function is taken or if inlining fails.  In general, we emit an
out-of-line copy in all translation units where one is needed.  As an
exception, we only emit inline virtual functions with the vtable, since
it will always require a copy.
<P>

Local static variables and string constants used in an inline function
are also considered to have vague linkage, since they must be shared
between all inlined and out-of-line instances of the function.
</P><P>

<DT>VTables
<DD><A NAME="IDX1487"></A>
C++ virtual functions are implemented in most compilers using a lookup
table, known as a vtable.  The vtable contains pointers to the virtual
functions provided by a class, and each object of the class contains a
pointer to its vtable (or vtables, in some multiple-inheritance
situations).  If the class declares any non-inline, non-pure virtual
functions, the first one is chosen as the "key method" for the class,
and the vtable is only emitted in the translation unit where the key
method is defined.
<P>

<EM>Note:</EM> If the chosen key method is later defined as inline, the
vtable will still be emitted in every translation unit which defines it.
Make sure that any inline virtuals are declared inline in the class
body, even if they are not defined there.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>type_info</CODE> objects
<DD><A NAME="IDX1488"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1489"></A>
C++ requires information about types to be written out in order to
implement <SAMP>`dynamic_cast'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`typeid'</SAMP> and exception handling.
For polymorphic classes (classes with virtual functions), the <SAMP>`type_info'</SAMP>
object is written out along with the vtable so that <SAMP>`dynamic_cast'</SAMP>
can determine the dynamic type of a class object at runtime.  For all
other types, we write out the <SAMP>`type_info'</SAMP> object when it is used: when
applying <SAMP>`typeid'</SAMP> to an expression, throwing an object, or
referring to a type in a catch clause or exception specification.
<P>

<DT>Template Instantiations
<DD>Most everything in this section also applies to template instantiations,
but there are other options as well.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC139">Where's the Template?</A>.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, duplicate copies of
these constructs will be discarded at link time.  This is known as
COMDAT support.
</P><P>

On targets that don't support COMDAT, but do support weak symbols, GCC
will use them.  This way one copy will override all the others, but
the unused copies will still take up space in the executable.
</P><P>

For targets which do not support either COMDAT or weak symbols,
most entities with vague linkage will be emitted as local symbols to
avoid duplicate definition errors from the linker.  This will not happen
for local statics in inlines, however, as having multiple copies will
almost certainly break things.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC138">Declarations and Definitions in One Header</A>, for
another way to control placement of these constructs.

<CODE>#pragma interface</CODE> and <CODE>#pragma implementation</CODE> provide the

translation unit.
</P><P>

<EM>Note:</EM> As of GCC 2.7.2, these <CODE>#pragma</CODE>s are not useful in
most cases, because of COMDAT support and the "key method" heuristic
mentioned in <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC137">7.3 Vague Linkage</A>.  Using them can actually cause your
program to grow due to unnecessary out-of-line copies of inline
functions.  Currently (3.4) the only benefit of these
<CODE>#pragma</CODE>s is reduced duplication of debugging information, and
that should be addressed soon on DWARF 2 targets with the use of
COMDAT groups.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>#pragma interface</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>#pragma interface "<VAR>subdir</VAR>/<VAR>objects</VAR>.h"</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1493"></A>
Use this directive in <EM>header files</EM> that define object classes, to save
space in most of the object files that use those classes.  Normally,
local copies of certain information (backup copies of inline member
functions, debugging information, and the internal tables that implement
virtual functions) must be kept in each object file that includes class
definitions.  You can use this pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a
header file containing <SAMP>`#pragma interface'</SAMP> is included in a
compilation, this auxiliary information will not be generated (unless
the main input source file itself uses <SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP>).
Instead, the object files will contain references to be resolved at link
time.
<P>

The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you have
multiple headers with the same name in different directories.  If you
use this form, you must specify the same string to <SAMP>`#pragma
implementation'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>#pragma implementation</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>#pragma implementation "<VAR>objects</VAR>.h"</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1494"></A>
Use this pragma in a <EM>main input file</EM>, when you want full output from
included header files to be generated (and made globally visible).  The
included header file, in turn, should use <SAMP>`#pragma interface'</SAMP>.
Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging information, and the
internal tables used to implement virtual functions are all generated in
implementation files.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1495"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1496"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1497"></A>
If you use <SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP> with no argument, it applies to
an include file with the same basename<A NAME="DOCF4" HREF="gcc.html#FOOT4">(4)</A> as your source
file.  For example, in <TT>`allclass.cc'</TT>, giving just
<SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP>
by itself is equivalent to <SAMP>`#pragma implementation "allclass.h"'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

In versions of GNU C++ prior to 2.6.0 <TT>`allclass.h'</TT> was treated as
an implementation file whenever you would include it from
<TT>`allclass.cc'</TT> even if you never specified <SAMP>`#pragma
implementation'</SAMP>.  This was deemed to be more trouble than it was worth,
however, and disabled.
</P><P>

Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
<SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> to include the header file; <SAMP>`#pragma
implementation'</SAMP> only specifies how to use the file--it doesn't actually
include it.)
</P><P>

There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file into
multiple implementation files.

<A NAME="IDX1499"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1500"></A>
<SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`#pragma interface'</SAMP> also have an
effect on function inlining.
</P><P>

If you define a class in a header file marked with <SAMP>`#pragma
interface'</SAMP>, the effect on an inline function defined in that class is
similar to an explicit <CODE>extern</CODE> declaration--the compiler emits
no code at all to define an independent version of the function.  Its
definition is used only for inlining with its callers.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1501"></A>
Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source file
that declares it as <SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP>, the compiler emits
code for the function itself; this defines a version of the function
that can be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without
inlining).  If all calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid
emitting the function by compiling with <SAMP>`-fno-implement-inlines'</SAMP>.
If any calls were not inlined, you will get linker errors.

<H2> 7.5 Where's the Template? </H2>
<!--docid::SEC139::-->
<P>

C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which are referred to as the Borland model and the Cfront model.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Borland model
<DD>Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding the code
equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler emits template
instances in each translation unit that uses them, and the linker
collapses them together.  The advantage of this model is that the linker
only has to consider the object files themselves; there is no external
complexity to worry about.  This disadvantage is that compilation time
is increased because the template code is being compiled repeatedly.
Code written for this model tends to include definitions of all
templates in the header file, since they must be seen to be
instantiated.
<P>

<DT>Cfront model
<DD>The AT&#38;T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
automatically maintained place where template instances are stored.  A
more modern version of the repository works as follows: As individual
object files are built, the compiler places any template definitions and
instantiations encountered in the repository.  At link time, the link
wrapper adds in the objects in the repository and compiles any needed
instances that were not previously emitted.  The advantages of this
model are more optimal compilation speed and the ability to use the
system linker; to implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also
needs to replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly increased
complexity, and thus potential for error; for some code this can be
just as transparent, but in practice it can been very difficult to build
multiple programs in one directory and one program in multiple
directories.  Code written for this model tends to separate definitions
of non-inline member templates into a separate file, which should be
compiled separately.
</DL>
<P>

When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, G++ supports the
Borland model.  On other systems, G++ implements neither automatic
model.
</P><P>

A future version of G++ will support a hybrid model whereby the compiler
will emit any instantiations for which the template definition is
included in the compile, and store template definitions and
instantiation context information into the object file for the rest.
The link wrapper will extract that information as necessary and invoke
the compiler to produce the remaining instantiations.  The linker will
then combine duplicate instantiations.
</P><P>

In the mean time, you have the following options for dealing with
template instantiations:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1502"></A>
Compile your template-using code with <SAMP>`-frepo'</SAMP>.  The compiler will
generate files with the extension <SAMP>`.rpo'</SAMP> listing all of the
template instantiations used in the corresponding object files which
could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, <SAMP>`collect2'</SAMP>, will
then update the <SAMP>`.rpo'</SAMP> files to tell the compiler where to place
those instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the compiler
will continue to place the instantiations in the same files.
<P>

This is your best option for application code written for the Borland
model, as it will just work.  Code written for the Cfront model will
need to be modified so that the template definitions are available at
one or more points of instantiation; usually this is as simple as adding
<CODE>#include &#60;tmethods.cc&#62;</CODE> to the end of each template header.
</P><P>

For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the template
instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its object files
together; the link will fail, but cause the instantiations to be
generated as a side effect.  Be warned, however, that this may cause
conflicts if multiple libraries try to provide the same instantiations.
For greater control, use explicit instantiation as described in the next
option.
</P><P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1503"></A>
Compile your code with <SAMP>`-fno-implicit-templates'</SAMP> to disable the
implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly instantiate
all the ones you use.  This approach requires more knowledge of exactly
which instances you need than do the others, but it's less
mysterious and allows greater control.  You can scatter the explicit
instantiations throughout your program, perhaps putting them in the
translation units where the instances are used or the translation units
that define the templates themselves; you can put all of the explicit
instantiations you need into one big file; or you can create small files
like
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#include "Foo.h"
#include "Foo.cc"

template class Foo&#60;int&#62;;
template ostream&#38; operator &#60;&#60;
                (ostream&#38;, const Foo&#60;int&#62;&#38;);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

for each of the instances you need, and create a template instantiation
library from those.
</P><P>

If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with not
using <SAMP>`-fno-implicit-templates'</SAMP> when compiling files that don't
<SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> the member template definitions.
</P><P>

If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
compile it without <SAMP>`-fno-implicit-templates'</SAMP> so you get all of the
instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
other files) without having to specify them as well.
</P><P>

G++ has extended the template instantiation syntax given in the ISO
standard to allow forward declaration of explicit instantiations
(with <CODE>extern</CODE>), instantiation of the compiler support data for a
template class (i.e. the vtable) without instantiating any of its
members (with <CODE>inline</CODE>), and instantiation of only the static data
members of a template class, without the support data or member
functions (with (<CODE>static</CODE>):
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern template int max (int, int);
inline template class Foo&#60;int&#62;;
static template class Foo&#60;int&#62;;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
Do nothing.  Pretend G++ does implement automatic instantiation
management.  Code written for the Borland model will work fine, but
each translation unit will contain instances of each of the templates it
uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable amount of code
duplication.

<H2> 7.6 Extracting the function pointer from a bound pointer to member function </H2>
<!--docid::SEC140::-->
<P>

In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a wide
pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the PMF
needs to store information about how to adjust the <SAMP>`this'</SAMP> pointer,
and if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
the inner loop, to save a bit of time.
</P><P>

Note that you will still be paying the penalty for the call through a
function pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the
branch prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal
virtual function calls.
</P><P>

The syntax for this extension is
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>extern A a;
extern int (A::*fp)();
typedef int (*fptr)(A *);

fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

For PMF constants (i.e. expressions of the form <SAMP>`&#38;Klasse::Member'</SAMP>),
no object is needed to obtain the address of the function.  They can be
converted to function pointers directly:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>fptr p1 = (fptr)(&#38;A::foo);

Some attributes only make sense for C++ programs.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>init_priority (<VAR>priority</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1505"></A>
<P>

In Standard C++, objects defined at namespace scope are guaranteed to be
initialized in an order in strict accordance with that of their definitions
<EM>in a given translation unit</EM>.  No guarantee is made for initializations
across translation units.  However, GNU C++ allows users to control the
order of initialization of objects defined at namespace scope with the
<CODE>init_priority</CODE> attribute by specifying a relative <VAR>priority</VAR>,
a constant integral expression currently bounded between 101 and 65535
inclusive.  Lower numbers indicate a higher priority.
</P><P>

In the following example, <CODE>A</CODE> would normally be created before
<CODE>B</CODE>, but the <CODE>init_priority</CODE> attribute has reversed that order:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>Some_Class  A  __attribute__ ((init_priority (2000)));
Some_Class  B  __attribute__ ((init_priority (543)));
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that the particular values of <VAR>priority</VAR> do not matter; only their
relative ordering.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>java_interface</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1506"></A>
<P>

This type attribute informs C++ that the class is a Java interface.  It may
only be applied to classes declared within an <CODE>extern "Java"</CODE> block.
Calls to methods declared in this interface will be dispatched using GCJ's
interface table mechanism, instead of regular virtual table dispatch.

<P>

<STRONG>Caution:</STRONG> The semantics of this extension are not fully
defined.  Users should refrain from using this extension as its
semantics may change subtly over time.  It is possible that this
extension will be removed in future versions of G++.
</P><P>

A using-directive with <CODE>__attribute ((strong))</CODE> is stronger
than a normal using-directive in two ways:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Templates from the used namespace can be specialized and explicitly
instantiated as though they were members of the using namespace.
<P>

<LI>
The using namespace is considered an associated namespace of all
templates in the used namespace for purposes of argument-dependent
name lookup.
</UL>
<P>

The used namespace must be nested within the using namespace so that
normal unqualified lookup works properly.
</P><P>

This is useful for composing a namespace transparently from
implementation namespaces.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>namespace std {

  template &#60;class T&#62; void f (A&#60;T&#62;);
}

int main()

<!--docid::SEC144::-->
<P>

The Java language uses a slightly different exception handling model
from C++.  Normally, GNU C++ will automatically detect when you are
writing C++ code that uses Java exceptions, and handle them
appropriately.  However, if C++ code only needs to execute destructors
when Java exceptions are thrown through it, GCC will guess incorrectly.
Sample problematic code is:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  struct S { ~S(); };
  extern void bar();    // is written in Java, and may throw exceptions
  void foo()

    S s;
    bar();

The usual effect of an incorrect guess is a link failure, complaining of
a missing routine called <SAMP>`__gxx_personality_v0'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

You can inform the compiler that Java exceptions are to be used in a
translation unit, irrespective of what it might think, by writing
<SAMP>`#pragma GCC java_exceptions'</SAMP> at the head of the file.  This
<SAMP>`#pragma'</SAMP> must appear before any functions that throw or catch
exceptions, or run destructors when exceptions are thrown through them.
</P><P>

You cannot mix Java and C++ exceptions in the same translation unit.  It
is believed to be safe to throw a C++ exception from one file through
another file compiled for the Java exception model, or vice versa, but
there may be bugs in this area.

<H2> 7.11 Deprecated Features </H2>
<!--docid::SEC145::-->
<P>

In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving.  Now that
the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superseded by
superior alternatives.  Using the old features might cause a warning in
some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future.  In other
cases, the feature might be gone already.
</P><P>

While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the options
that are now deprecated:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fexternal-templates</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-falt-external-templates</CODE>
<DD>These are two of the many ways for G++ to implement template
instantiation.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC139">7.5 Where's the Template?</A>.  The C++ standard clearly
defines how template definitions have to be organized across
implementation units.  G++ has an implicit instantiation mechanism that
should work just fine for standard-conforming code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fstrict-prototype</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-strict-prototype</CODE>
<DD>Previously it was possible to use an empty prototype parameter list to
indicate an unspecified number of parameters (like C), rather than no
parameters, as C++ demands.  This feature has been removed, except where
it is required for backwards compatibility.   See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC146">7.12 Backwards Compatibility</A>.
</DL>
<P>

G++ allows a virtual function returning <SAMP>`void *'</SAMP> to be overridden
by one returning a different pointer type.  This extension to the
covariant return type rules is now deprecated and will be removed from a
future version.
</P><P>

The G++ minimum and maximum operators (<SAMP>`&#60;?'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`&#62;?'</SAMP>) and
their compound forms (<SAMP>`&#60;?='</SAMP>) and <SAMP>`&#62;?='</SAMP>) have been deprecated
and are now removed from G++.  Code using these operators should be
modified to use <CODE>std::min</CODE> and <CODE>std::max</CODE> instead.
</P><P>

The named return value extension has been deprecated, and is now
removed from G++.
</P><P>

The use of initializer lists with new expressions has been deprecated,
and is now removed from G++.
</P><P>

Floating and complex non-type template parameters have been deprecated,
and are now removed from G++.
</P><P>

The implicit typename extension has been deprecated and is now
removed from G++.
</P><P>

The use of default arguments in function pointers, function typedefs
and other places where they are not permitted by the standard is
deprecated and will be removed from a future version of G++.
</P><P>

G++ allows floating-point literals to appear in integral constant expressions,
e.g. <SAMP>` enum E { e = int(2.2 * 3.7) } '</SAMP>
This extension is deprecated and will be removed from a future version.
</P><P>

G++ allows static data members of const floating-point type to be declared
with an initializer in a class definition. The standard only allows
initializers for static members of const integral types and const
enumeration types so this extension has been deprecated and will be removed
from a future version.

<H2> 7.12 Backwards Compatibility </H2>
<!--docid::SEC146::-->
<P>

Now that there is a definitive ISO standard C++, G++ has a specification
to adhere to.  The C++ language evolved over time, and features that
used to be acceptable in previous drafts of the standard, such as the ARM
[Annotated C++ Reference Manual], are no longer accepted.  In order to allow
compilation of C++ written to such drafts, G++ contains some backwards
compatibilities.  <EM>All such backwards compatibility features are
liable to disappear in future versions of G++.</EM> They should be considered
deprecated.   See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC145">7.11 Deprecated Features</A>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>For scope</CODE>
<DD>If a variable is declared at for scope, it used to remain in scope until
the end of the scope which contained the for statement (rather than just
within the for scope).  G++ retains this, but issues a warning, if such a
variable is accessed outside the for scope.
<P>

<DT><CODE>Implicit C language</CODE>
<DD>Old C system header files did not contain an <CODE>extern "C" {<small>...</small>}</CODE>
scope to set the language.  On such systems, all header files are
implicitly scoped inside a C language scope.  Also, an empty prototype
<CODE>()</CODE> will be treated as an unspecified number of arguments, rather
than no arguments, as C++ demands.

<H2> 8.1 GNU Objective-C runtime API </H2>
<!--docid::SEC148::-->
<P>

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.
</P><P>

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API that allows you to
interact with the Objective-C runtime system, querying the live
runtime structures and even manipulating them.  This allows you for
example to inspect and navigate classes, methods and protocols; to
define new classes or new methods, and even to modify existing classes
or protocols.
</P><P>

If you are using a "Foundation" library such as GNUstep-Base, this
library will provide you with a rich set of functionality to do most
of the inspection tasks, and you probably will only need direct access
to the GNU Objective-C runtime API to define new classes or methods.

<H3> 8.1.1 Modern GNU Objective-C runtime API </H3>
<!--docid::SEC149::-->
<P>

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API which is similar to the
one provided by the "Objective-C 2.0" Apple/NeXT Objective-C
runtime.  The API is documented in the public header files of the GNU
Objective-C runtime:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
<TT>`objc/objc.h'</TT>: this is the basic Objective-C header file,
defining the basic Objective-C types such as <CODE>id</CODE>, <CODE>Class</CODE>
and <CODE>BOOL</CODE>.  You have to include this header to do almost
anything with Objective-C.
<P>

<LI>
<TT>`objc/runtime.h'</TT>: this header declares most of the public runtime
API functions allowing you to inspect and manipulate the Objective-C
runtime data structures.  These functions are fairly standardized
across Objective-C runtimes and are almost identical to the Apple/NeXT
Objective-C runtime ones.  It does not declare functions in some
specialized areas (constructing and forwarding message invocations,
threading) which are in the other headers below.  You have to include
<TT>`objc/objc.h'</TT> and <TT>`objc/runtime.h'</TT> to use any of the
functions, such as <CODE>class_getName()</CODE>, declared in
<TT>`objc/runtime.h'</TT>.
<P>

<LI>
<TT>`objc/message.h'</TT>: this header declares public functions used to
construct, deconstruct and forward message invocations.  Because
messaging is done in quite a different way on different runtimes,
functions in this header are specific to the GNU Objective-C runtime
implementation.
<P>

<LI>
<TT>`objc/objc-exception.h'</TT>: this header declares some public
functions related to Objective-C exceptions.  For example functions in
this header allow you to throw an Objective-C exception from plain
C/C++ code.
<P>

<LI>
<TT>`objc/objc-sync.h'</TT>: this header declares some public functions
related to the Objective-C <CODE>@synchronized()</CODE> syntax, allowing
you to emulate an Objective-C <CODE>@synchronized()</CODE> block in plain
C/C++ code.
<P>

<LI>
<TT>`objc/thr.h'</TT>: this header declares a public runtime API threading
layer that is only provided by the GNU Objective-C runtime.  It
declares functions such as <CODE>objc_mutex_lock()</CODE>, which provide a
platform-independent set of threading functions.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

The header files contain detailed documentation for each function in
the GNU Objective-C runtime API.

<!--docid::SEC150::-->
<P>

The GNU Objective-C runtime used to provide a different API, which we
call the "traditional" GNU Objective-C runtime API.  Functions
belonging to this API are easy to recognize because they use a
different naming convention, such as <CODE>class_get_super_class()</CODE>
(traditional API) instead of <CODE>class_getSuperclass()</CODE> (modern
API).  Software using this API includes the file
<TT>`objc/objc-api.h'</TT> where it is declared.
</P><P>

Starting with GCC 4.7.0, the traditional GNU runtime API is no longer
available.

<H2> 8.2 <CODE>+load</CODE>: Executing code before main </H2>
<!--docid::SEC151::-->
<P>

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.
</P><P>

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a way that allows you to execute
code before the execution of the program enters the <CODE>main</CODE>
function.  The code is executed on a per-class and a per-category basis,
through a special class method <CODE>+load</CODE>.
</P><P>

This facility is very useful if you want to initialize global variables
which can be accessed by the program directly, without sending a message
to the class first.  The usual way to initialize global variables, in the
<CODE>+initialize</CODE> method, might not be useful because
<CODE>+initialize</CODE> is only called when the first message is sent to a
class object, which in some cases could be too late.
</P><P>

Suppose for example you have a <CODE>FileStream</CODE> class that declares
<CODE>Stdin</CODE>, <CODE>Stdout</CODE> and <CODE>Stderr</CODE> as global variables, like
below:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>
FileStream *Stdin = nil;
FileStream *Stdout = nil;
FileStream *Stderr = nil;

@implementation FileStream

+ (void)initialize
{
    Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
    Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
    Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
}

/* Other methods here */
@end

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, the initialization of <CODE>Stdin</CODE>, <CODE>Stdout</CODE> and
<CODE>Stderr</CODE> in <CODE>+initialize</CODE> occurs too late.  The programmer can
send a message to one of these objects before the variables are actually
initialized, thus sending messages to the <CODE>nil</CODE> object.  The
<CODE>+initialize</CODE> method which actually initializes the global
variables is not invoked until the first message is sent to the class
object.  The solution would require these variables to be initialized
just before entering <CODE>main</CODE>.
</P><P>

The correct solution of the above problem is to use the <CODE>+load</CODE>
method instead of <CODE>+initialize</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>
@implementation FileStream

+ (void)load
{
    Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
    Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
    Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
}

/* Other methods here */
@end

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>+load</CODE> is a method that is not overridden by categories.  If a
class and a category of it both implement <CODE>+load</CODE>, both methods are
invoked.  This allows some additional initializations to be performed in
a category.
</P><P>

This mechanism is not intended to be a replacement for <CODE>+initialize</CODE>.
You should be aware of its limitations when you decide to use it
instead of <CODE>+initialize</CODE>.

<H3> 8.2.1 What you can and what you cannot do in <CODE>+load</CODE> </H3>
<!--docid::SEC152::-->
<P>

<CODE>+load</CODE> is to be used only as a last resort.  Because it is
executed very early, most of the Objective-C runtime machinery will
not be ready when <CODE>+load</CODE> is executed; hence <CODE>+load</CODE> works
best for executing C code that is independent on the Objective-C
runtime.
</P><P>

The <CODE>+load</CODE> implementation in the GNU runtime guarantees you the
following things:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
you can write whatever C code you like;
<P>

<LI>
you can allocate and send messages to objects whose class is implemented
in the same file;
<P>

<LI>
the <CODE>+load</CODE> implementation of all super classes of a class are
executed before the <CODE>+load</CODE> of that class is executed;
<P>

<LI>
the <CODE>+load</CODE> implementation of a class is executed before the
<CODE>+load</CODE> implementation of any category.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

In particular, the following things, even if they can work in a
particular case, are not guaranteed:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
allocation of or sending messages to arbitrary objects;
<P>

<LI>
allocation of or sending messages to objects whose classes have a
category implemented in the same file;
<P>

<LI>
sending messages to Objective-C constant strings (<CODE>@"this is a
constant string"</CODE>);
<P>

</UL>
<P>

You should make no assumptions about receiving <CODE>+load</CODE> in sibling
classes when you write <CODE>+load</CODE> of a class.  The order in which
sibling classes receive <CODE>+load</CODE> is not guaranteed.
</P><P>

The order in which <CODE>+load</CODE> and <CODE>+initialize</CODE> are called could
be problematic if this matters.  If you don't allocate objects inside
<CODE>+load</CODE>, it is guaranteed that <CODE>+load</CODE> is called before
<CODE>+initialize</CODE>.  If you create an object inside <CODE>+load</CODE> the
<CODE>+initialize</CODE> method of object's class is invoked even if
<CODE>+load</CODE> was not invoked.  Note if you explicitly call <CODE>+load</CODE>
on a class, <CODE>+initialize</CODE> will be called first.  To avoid possible
problems try to implement only one of these methods.
</P><P>

The <CODE>+load</CODE> method is also invoked when a bundle is dynamically
loaded into your running program.  This happens automatically without any
intervening operation from you.  When you write bundles and you need to
write <CODE>+load</CODE> you can safely create and send messages to objects whose
classes already exist in the running program.  The same restrictions as
above apply to classes defined in bundle.

<H2> 8.3 Type encoding </H2>
<!--docid::SEC153::-->
<P>

This is an advanced section.  Type encodings are used extensively by
the compiler and by the runtime, but you generally do not need to know
about them to use Objective-C.
</P><P>

The Objective-C compiler generates type encodings for all the types.
These type encodings are used at runtime to find out information about
selectors and methods and about objects and classes.
</P><P>

The types are encoded in the following way:
</P><P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><CODE>_Bool</CODE></TD>
</TD><TD> <CODE>B</CODE>

</TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>char*</CODE></TD>
</TD><TD> <CODE>*</CODE>
</TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>enum</CODE></TD>
</TD><TD> an <CODE>enum</CODE> is encoded exactly as the integer type that the compiler uses for it, which depends on the enumeration
values.  Often the compiler users <CODE>unsigned int</CODE>, which is then encoded as <CODE>I</CODE>.
</TR>
<TR><TD>unknown type</TD>
</TD><TD> <CODE>?</CODE>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Complex types</TD>
</TD><TD> <CODE>j</CODE> followed by the inner type.  For example <CODE>_Complex double</CODE> is encoded as "jd".
</TR>
<TR><TD>bit-fields</TD>
</TD><TD> <CODE>b</CODE> followed by the starting position of the bit-field, the type of the bit-field and the size of the bit-field (the bit-fields encoding was changed from the NeXT's compiler encoding, see below)
</TR></TABLE>
<P>

The encoding of bit-fields has changed to allow bit-fields to be
properly handled by the runtime functions that compute sizes and
alignments of types that contain bit-fields.  The previous encoding
contained only the size of the bit-field.  Using only this information
it is not possible to reliably compute the size occupied by the
bit-field.  This is very important in the presence of the Boehm's
garbage collector because the objects are allocated using the typed
memory facility available in this collector.  The typed memory
allocation requires information about where the pointers are located
inside the object.
</P><P>

The position in the bit-field is the position, counting in bits, of the
bit closest to the beginning of the structure.
</P><P>

The non-atomic types are encoded as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>pointers</TD>
</TD><TD> <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> followed by the pointed type.
</TR>
<TR><TD>arrays</TD>
</TD><TD> <SAMP>`['</SAMP> followed by the number of elements in the array followed by the type of the elements followed by <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>
</TR>
<TR><TD>structures</TD>
</TD><TD> <SAMP>`{'</SAMP> followed by the name of the structure (or <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> if the structure is unnamed), the <SAMP>`='</SAMP> sign, the type of the members and by <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>
</TR>
<TR><TD>unions</TD>
</TD><TD> <SAMP>`('</SAMP> followed by the name of the structure (or <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> if the union is unnamed), the <SAMP>`='</SAMP> sign, the type of the members followed by <SAMP>`)'</SAMP>
</TR>
<TR><TD>vectors</TD>
</TD><TD> <SAMP>`!['</SAMP> followed by the vector_size (the number of bytes composing the vector) followed by a comma, followed by the alignment (in bytes) of the vector, followed by the type of the elements followed by <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>
</TR></TABLE>
<P>

Here are some types and their encodings, as they are generated by the
compiler on an i386 machine:
</P><P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>Objective-C type</TD>
</TD><TD> Compiler encoding
</TR>
<TR><TD></TD>

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></TD><TD> <CODE>![16,16i]</CODE> (alignment would depend on the machine)
</TR></TABLE>
<P>

In addition to the types the compiler also encodes the type
specifiers.  The table below describes the encoding of the current
Objective-C type specifiers:
</P><P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>Specifier</TD>
</TD><TD> Encoding
</TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>const</CODE></TD>
</TD><TD> <CODE>r</CODE>
</TR>

</TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>inout</CODE></TD>

</TD><TD> <CODE>R</CODE>
</TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>oneway</CODE></TD>
</TD><TD> <CODE>V</CODE>
</TR></TABLE>
<P>

The type specifiers are encoded just before the type.  Unlike types
however, the type specifiers are only encoded when they appear in method
argument types.
</P><P>

Note how <CODE>const</CODE> interacts with pointers:
</P><P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>Objective-C type</TD>
</TD><TD> Compiler encoding
</TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>const int

</TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int *const
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></TD><TD> <CODE>r^i</CODE>
</TR></TABLE>
<P>

<CODE>const int*</CODE> is a pointer to a <CODE>const int</CODE>, and so is
encoded as <CODE>^ri</CODE>.  <CODE>int* const</CODE>, instead, is a <CODE>const</CODE>
pointer to an <CODE>int</CODE>, and so is encoded as <CODE>r^i</CODE>.
</P><P>

Finally, there is a complication when encoding <CODE>const char *</CODE>
versus <CODE>char * const</CODE>.  Because <CODE>char *</CODE> is encoded as
<CODE>*</CODE> and not as <CODE>^c</CODE>, there is no way to express the fact
that <CODE>r</CODE> applies to the pointer or to the pointee.
</P><P>

Hence, it is assumed as a convention that <CODE>r*</CODE> means <CODE>const
char *</CODE> (since it is what is most often meant), and there is no way to
encode <CODE>char *const</CODE>.  <CODE>char *const</CODE> would simply be encoded
as <CODE>*</CODE>, and the <CODE>const</CODE> is lost.

<H3> 8.3.1 Legacy type encoding </H3>
<!--docid::SEC154::-->
<P>

Unfortunately, historically GCC used to have a number of bugs in its
encoding code.  The NeXT runtime expects GCC to emit type encodings in
this historical format (compatible with GCC-3.3), so when using the
NeXT runtime, GCC will introduce on purpose a number of incorrect
encodings:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
the read-only qualifier of the pointee gets emitted before the '^'.
The read-only qualifier of the pointer itself gets ignored, unless it
is a typedef.  Also, the 'r' is only emitted for the outermost type.
<P>

<LI>
32-bit longs are encoded as 'l' or 'L', but not always.  For typedefs,
the compiler uses 'i' or 'I' instead if encoding a struct field or a
pointer.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>enum</CODE>s are always encoded as 'i' (int) even if they are actually
unsigned or long.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

In addition to that, the NeXT runtime uses a different encoding for
bitfields.  It encodes them as <CODE>b</CODE> followed by the size, without
a bit offset or the underlying field type.

GNU Objective-C supports the <CODE>@encode</CODE> syntax that allows you to
create a type encoding from a C/Objective-C type.  For example,
<CODE>@encode(int)</CODE> is compiled by the compiler into <CODE>"i"</CODE>.
</P><P>

<CODE>@encode</CODE> does not support type qualifiers other than
<CODE>const</CODE>.  For example, <CODE>@encode(const char*)</CODE> is valid and
is compiled into <CODE>"r*"</CODE>, while <CODE>@encode(bycopy char *)</CODE> is
invalid and will cause a compilation error.

<H3> 8.3.3 Method signatures </H3>
<!--docid::SEC156::-->
<P>

This section documents the encoding of method types, which is rarely
needed to use Objective-C.  You should skip it at a first reading; the
runtime provides functions that will work on methods and can walk
through the list of parameters and interpret them for you.  These
functions are part of the public "API" and are the preferred way to
interact with method signatures from user code.
</P><P>

But if you need to debug a problem with method signatures and need to
know how they are implemented (i.e., the "ABI"), read on.
</P><P>

Methods have their "signature" encoded and made available to the
runtime.  The "signature" encodes all the information required to
dynamically build invocations of the method at runtime: return type
and arguments.
</P><P>

The "signature" is a null-terminated string, composed of the following:
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI>
The return type, including type qualifiers.  For example, a method
returning <CODE>int</CODE> would have <CODE>i</CODE> here.
<P>

<LI>
The total size (in bytes) required to pass all the parameters.  This
includes the two hidden parameters (the object <CODE>self</CODE> and the
method selector <CODE>_cmd</CODE>).
<P>

<LI>
Each argument, with the type encoding, followed by the offset (in
bytes) of the argument in the list of parameters.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

For example, a method with no arguments and returning <CODE>int</CODE> would
have the signature <CODE>i8@0:4</CODE> if the size of a pointer is 4.  The
signature is interpreted as follows: the <CODE>i</CODE> is the return type
(an <CODE>int</CODE>), the <CODE>8</CODE> is the total size of the parameters in
bytes (two pointers each of size 4), the <CODE>@0</CODE> is the first
parameter (an object at byte offset <CODE>0</CODE>) and <CODE>:4</CODE> is the
second parameter (a <CODE>SEL</CODE> at byte offset <CODE>4</CODE>).
</P><P>

You can easily find more examples by running the "strings" program
on an Objective-C object file compiled by GCC.  You'll see a lot of
strings that look very much like <CODE>i8@0:4</CODE>.  They are signatures
of Objective-C methods.

<H2> 8.4 Garbage Collection </H2>
<!--docid::SEC157::-->
<P>

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.
</P><P>

Support for garbage collection with the GNU runtime has been added by
using a powerful conservative garbage collector, known as the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector.
</P><P>

To enable the support for it you have to configure the compiler using
an additional argument, <SAMP>`--enable-objc-gc'</SAMP>.  This will
build the boehm-gc library, and build an additional runtime library
which has several enhancements to support the garbage collector.  The
new library has a new name, <TT>`libobjc_gc.a'</TT> to not conflict with
the non-garbage-collected library.
</P><P>

When the garbage collector is used, the objects are allocated using the
so-called typed memory allocation mechanism available in the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector.  This mode requires precise information on
where pointers are located inside objects.  This information is computed
once per class, immediately after the class has been initialized.
</P><P>

There is a new runtime function <CODE>class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()</CODE>
which can be used to declare a so-called <EM>weak pointer</EM>
reference.  Such a pointer is basically hidden for the garbage collector;
this can be useful in certain situations, especially when you want to
keep track of the allocated objects, yet allow them to be
collected.  This kind of pointers can only be members of objects, you
cannot declare a global pointer as a weak reference.  Every type which is
a pointer type can be declared a weak pointer, including <CODE>id</CODE>,
<CODE>Class</CODE> and <CODE>SEL</CODE>.
</P><P>

Here is an example of how to use this feature.  Suppose you want to
implement a class whose instances hold a weak pointer reference; the
following class does this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>
@interface WeakPointer : Object
{
    const void* weakPointer;
}

- initWithPointer:(const void*)p;
- (const void*)weakPointer;
@end


@implementation WeakPointer

+ (void)initialize
{
  if (self == objc_lookUpClass ("WeakPointer"))
    class_ivar_set_gcinvisible (self, "weakPointer", YES);
}

- initWithPointer:(const void*)p
{
  weakPointer = p;
  return self;
}

- (const void*)weakPointer
{
  return weakPointer;
}

<H2> 8.5 Constant string objects </H2>
<!--docid::SEC158::-->
<P>

GNU Objective-C provides constant string objects that are generated
directly by the compiler.  You declare a constant string object by
prefixing a C constant string with the character <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  id myString = @"this is a constant string object";
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The constant string objects are by default instances of the
<CODE>NXConstantString</CODE> class which is provided by the GNU Objective-C
runtime.  To get the definition of this class you must include the
<TT>`objc/NXConstStr.h'</TT> header file.
</P><P>

User defined libraries may want to implement their own constant string
class.  To be able to support them, the GNU Objective-C compiler provides
a new command line options <SAMP>`-fconstant-string-class=<VAR>class-name</VAR>'</SAMP>.
The provided class should adhere to a strict structure, the same
as <CODE>NXConstantString</CODE>'s structure:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>
@interface MyConstantStringClass
{
  Class isa;
  char *c_string;
  unsigned int len;
}
@end

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<CODE>NXConstantString</CODE> inherits from <CODE>Object</CODE>; user class
libraries may choose to inherit the customized constant string class
from a different class than <CODE>Object</CODE>.  There is no requirement in
the methods the constant string class has to implement, but the final
ivar layout of the class must be the compatible with the given
structure.
</P><P>

When the compiler creates the statically allocated constant string
object, the <CODE>c_string</CODE> field will be filled by the compiler with
the string; the <CODE>length</CODE> field will be filled by the compiler with
the string length; the <CODE>isa</CODE> pointer will be filled with
<CODE>NULL</CODE> by the compiler, and it will later be fixed up automatically
at runtime by the GNU Objective-C runtime library to point to the class
which was set by the <SAMP>`-fconstant-string-class'</SAMP> option when the
object file is loaded (if you wonder how it works behind the scenes, the
name of the class to use, and the list of static objects to fixup, are
stored by the compiler in the object file in a place where the GNU
runtime library will find them at runtime).
</P><P>

As a result, when a file is compiled with the
<SAMP>`-fconstant-string-class'</SAMP> option, all the constant string objects
will be instances of the class specified as argument to this option.  It
is possible to have multiple compilation units referring to different
constant string classes, neither the compiler nor the linker impose any
restrictions in doing this.

<H2> 8.6 compatibility_alias </H2>
<!--docid::SEC159::-->
<P>

The keyword <CODE>@compatibility_alias</CODE> allows you to define a class name
as equivalent to another class name.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>@compatibility_alias WOApplication GSWApplication;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

tells the compiler that each time it encounters <CODE>WOApplication</CODE> as
a class name, it should replace it with <CODE>GSWApplication</CODE> (that is,
<CODE>WOApplication</CODE> is just an alias for <CODE>GSWApplication</CODE>).
</P><P>

There are some constraints on how this can be used---
</P><P>

<UL>

<LI><CODE>WOApplication</CODE> (the alias) must not be an existing class;
<P>

<LI><CODE>GSWApplication</CODE> (the real class) must be an existing class.

<H2> 8.7 Exceptions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC160::-->
<P>

GNU Objective-C provides exception support built into the language, as
in the following example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  @try {
    <small>...</small>
       @throw expr;
    <small>...</small>
  }
  @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
    <small>...</small>
      @throw expr;
    <small>...</small>
      @throw;
    <small>...</small>
  }
  @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
    <small>...</small>
  }
  @catch (id allOthers) {
    <small>...</small>
  }
  @finally {
    <small>...</small>
      @throw expr;
    <small>...</small>
  }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>@throw</CODE> statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a <CODE>@catch</CODE> block, the
<CODE>@throw</CODE> may appear without an argument (as shown above), in
which case the object caught by the <CODE>@catch</CODE> will be rethrown.
</P><P>

Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest <CODE>@catch</CODE> clause capable of handling objects of
that type, analogously to how <CODE>catch</CODE> blocks work in C++ and
Java.  A <CODE>@catch(id <small>...</small>)</CODE> clause (as shown above) may also
be provided to catch any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by
previous <CODE>@catch</CODE> clauses (if any).
</P><P>

The <CODE>@finally</CODE> clause, if present, will be executed upon exit
from the immediately preceding <CODE>@try <small>...</small> @catch</CODE> section.
This will happen regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown,
caught or rethrown inside the <CODE>@try <small>...</small> @catch</CODE> section,
analogously to the behavior of the <CODE>finally</CODE> clause in Java.
</P><P>

There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
The <SAMP>`-fobjc-exceptions'</SAMP> command line option must be used when
compiling Objective-C files that use exceptions.
<P>

<LI>
With the GNU runtime, exceptions are always implemented as "native"
exceptions and it is recommended that the <SAMP>`-fexceptions'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-shared-libgcc'</SAMP> options are used when linking.
<P>

<LI>
With the NeXT runtime, although currently designed to be binary
compatible with <CODE>NS_HANDLER</CODE>-style idioms provided by the
<CODE>NSException</CODE> class, the new exceptions can only be used on Mac
OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later systems, due to additional functionality
needed in the NeXT Objective-C runtime.
<P>

<LI>
As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with C++
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot <CODE>@throw</CODE> an exception
from Objective-C and <CODE>catch</CODE> it in C++, or vice versa
(i.e., <CODE>throw <small>...</small> @catch</CODE>).

<H2> 8.8 Synchronization </H2>
<!--docid::SEC161::-->
<P>

GNU Objective-C provides support for synchronized blocks:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
    <small>...</small>
  }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Upon entering the <CODE>@synchronized</CODE> block, a thread of execution
shall first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding
<CODE>guard</CODE> object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread
shall wait until the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once
<CODE>guard</CODE> becomes available, the current thread will place its own
lock on it, execute the code contained in the <CODE>@synchronized</CODE>
block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby making <CODE>guard</CODE>
available to other threads).
</P><P>

Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be
marked <CODE>@synchronized</CODE>.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
<CODE>@synchronized</CODE> blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding
object to be unlocked properly.
</P><P>

Because of the interactions between synchronization and exception
handling, you can only use <CODE>@synchronized</CODE> when compiling with
exceptions enabled, that is with the command line option
<SAMP>`-fobjc-exceptions'</SAMP>.

<H3> 8.9.1 Using fast enumeration </H3>
<!--docid::SEC163::-->
<P>

GNU Objective-C provides support for the fast enumeration syntax:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  id array = <small>...</small>;
  id object;

  for (object in array)
  {
    /* Do something with 'object' */
  }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<CODE>array</CODE> needs to be an Objective-C object (usually a collection
object, for example an array, a dictionary or a set) which implements
the "Fast Enumeration Protocol" (see below).  If you are using a
Foundation library such as GNUstep Base or Apple Cocoa Foundation, all
collection objects in the library implement this protocol and can be
used in this way.
</P><P>

The code above would iterate over all objects in <CODE>array</CODE>.  For
each of them, it assigns it to <CODE>object</CODE>, then executes the
<CODE>Do something with 'object'</CODE> statements.
</P><P>

Here is a fully worked-out example using a Foundation library (which
provides the implementation of <CODE>NSArray</CODE>, <CODE>NSString</CODE> and
<CODE>NSLog</CODE>):
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"1", @"2", @"3", nil];

<H3> 8.9.3 Fast enumeration details </H3>
<!--docid::SEC165::-->
<P>

Here is a more technical description with the gory details.  Consider the code
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  for (<VAR>object expression</VAR> in <VAR>collection expression</VAR>)
  {
    <VAR>statements</VAR>
  }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

here is what happens when you run it:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
<CODE><VAR>collection expression</VAR></CODE> is evaluated exactly once and the
result is used as the collection object to iterate over.  This means
it is safe to write code such as <CODE>for (object in [NSDictionary
keyEnumerator]) <small>...</small></CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
the iteration is implemented by the compiler by repeatedly getting
batches of objects from the collection object using the fast
enumeration protocol (see below), then iterating over all objects in
the batch.  This is faster than a normal enumeration where objects are
retrieved one by one (hence the name "fast enumeration").
<P>

<LI>
if there are no objects in the collection, then
<CODE><VAR>object expression</VAR></CODE> is set to <CODE>nil</CODE> and the loop
immediately terminates.
<P>

<LI>
if there are objects in the collection, then for each object in the
collection (in the order they are returned) <CODE><VAR>object expression</VAR></CODE>
is set to the object, then <CODE><VAR>statements</VAR></CODE> are executed.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE><VAR>statements</VAR></CODE> can contain <CODE>break</CODE> and <CODE>continue</CODE>
commands, which will abort the iteration or skip to the next loop
iteration as expected.
<P>

<LI>
when the iteration ends because there are no more objects to iterate
over, <CODE><VAR>object expression</VAR></CODE> is set to <CODE>nil</CODE>.  This allows
you to determine whether the iteration finished because a <CODE>break</CODE>
command was used (in which case <CODE><VAR>object expression</VAR></CODE> will remain
set to the last object that was iterated over) or because it iterated
over all the objects (in which case <CODE><VAR>object expression</VAR></CODE> will be
set to <CODE>nil</CODE>).
<P>

<LI>
<CODE><VAR>statements</VAR></CODE> must not make any changes to the collection
object; if they do, it is a hard error and the fast enumeration
terminates by invoking <CODE>objc_enumerationMutation</CODE>, a runtime
function that normally aborts the program but which can be customized
by Foundation libraries via <CODE>objc_set_mutation_handler</CODE> to do
something different, such as raising an exception.

<H3> 8.9.4 Fast enumeration protocol </H3>
<!--docid::SEC166::-->
<P>

If you want your own collection object to be usable with fast
enumeration, you need to have it implement the method
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>- (unsigned long) countByEnumeratingWithState: (NSFastEnumerationState *)state
                                      objects: (id *)objects
                                        count: (unsigned long)len;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

where <CODE>NSFastEnumerationState</CODE> must be defined in your code as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef struct
{
  unsigned long state;
  id            *itemsPtr;
  unsigned long *mutationsPtr;
  unsigned long extra[5];
} NSFastEnumerationState;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If no <CODE>NSFastEnumerationState</CODE> is defined in your code, the
compiler will automatically replace <CODE>NSFastEnumerationState *</CODE>
with <CODE>struct __objcFastEnumerationState *</CODE>, where that type is
silently defined by the compiler in an identical way.  This can be
confusing and we recommend that you define
<CODE>NSFastEnumerationState</CODE> (as shown above) instead.
</P><P>

The method is called repeatedly during a fast enumeration to retrieve
batches of objects.  Each invocation of the method should retrieve the
next batch of objects.
</P><P>

The return value of the method is the number of objects in the current
batch; this should not exceed <CODE>len</CODE>, which is the maximum size of
a batch as requested by the caller.  The batch itself is returned in
the <CODE>itemsPtr</CODE> field of the <CODE>NSFastEnumerationState</CODE> struct.
</P><P>

To help with returning the objects, the <CODE>objects</CODE> array is a C
array preallocated by the caller (on the stack) of size <CODE>len</CODE>.
In many cases you can put the objects you want to return in that
<CODE>objects</CODE> array, then do <CODE>itemsPtr = objects</CODE>.  But you
don't have to; if your collection already has the objects to return in
some form of C array, it could return them from there instead.
</P><P>

The <CODE>state</CODE> and <CODE>extra</CODE> fields of the
<CODE>NSFastEnumerationState</CODE> structure allows your collection object
to keep track of the state of the enumeration.  In a simple array
implementation, <CODE>state</CODE> may keep track of the index of the last
object that was returned, and <CODE>extra</CODE> may be unused.
</P><P>

The <CODE>mutationsPtr</CODE> field of the <CODE>NSFastEnumerationState</CODE> is
used to keep track of mutations.  It should point to a number; before
working on each object, the fast enumeration loop will check that this
number has not changed.  If it has, a mutation has happened and the
fast enumeration will abort.  So, <CODE>mutationsPtr</CODE> could be set to
point to some sort of version number of your collection, which is
increased by one every time there is a change (for example when an
object is added or removed).  Or, if you are content with less strict
mutation checks, it could point to the number of objects in your
collection or some other value that can be checked to perform an
approximate check that the collection has not been mutated.
</P><P>

Finally, note how we declared the <CODE>len</CODE> argument and the return
value to be of type <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>.  They could also be declared
to be of type <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> and everything would still work.

<H2> 8.10 Messaging with the GNU Objective-C runtime </H2>
<!--docid::SEC167::-->
<P>

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.
</P><P>

The implementation of messaging in the GNU Objective-C runtime is
designed to be portable, and so is based on standard C.
</P><P>

Sending a message in the GNU Objective-C runtime is composed of two
separate steps.  First, there is a call to the lookup function,
<CODE>objc_msg_lookup ()</CODE> (or, in the case of messages to super,
<CODE>objc_msg_lookup_super ()</CODE>).  This runtime function takes as
argument the receiver and the selector of the method to be called; it
returns the <CODE>IMP</CODE>, that is a pointer to the function implementing
the method.  The second step of method invocation consists of casting
this pointer function to the appropriate function pointer type, and
calling the function pointed to it with the right arguments.
</P><P>

For example, when the compiler encounters a method invocation such as
<CODE>[object init]</CODE>, it compiles it into a call to
<CODE>objc_msg_lookup (object, @selector(init))</CODE> followed by a cast
of the returned value to the appropriate function pointer type, and
then it calls it.

<!--docid::SEC168::-->
<P>

If <CODE>objc_msg_lookup()</CODE> does not find a suitable method
implementation, because the receiver does not implement the required
method, it tries to see if the class can dynamically register the
method.
</P><P>

To do so, the runtime checks if the class of the receiver implements
the method
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>+ (BOOL) resolveInstanceMethod: (SEL)selector;

</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>+ (BOOL) resolveClassMethod: (SEL)selector;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

in the case of a class method.  If the class implements it, the
runtime invokes it, passing as argument the selector of the original
method, and if it returns <CODE>YES</CODE>, the runtime tries the lookup
again, which could now succeed if a matching method was added
dynamically by <CODE>+resolveInstanceMethod:</CODE> or
<CODE>+resolveClassMethod:</CODE>.
</P><P>

This allows classes to dynamically register methods (by adding them to
the class using <CODE>class_addMethod</CODE>) when they are first called.
To do so, a class should implement <CODE>+resolveInstanceMethod:</CODE> (or,
depending on the case, <CODE>+resolveClassMethod:</CODE>) and have it
recognize the selectors of methods that can be registered dynamically
at runtime, register them, and return <CODE>YES</CODE>.  It should return
<CODE>NO</CODE> for methods that it does not dynamically registered at
runtime.
</P><P>

If <CODE>+resolveInstanceMethod:</CODE> (or <CODE>+resolveClassMethod:</CODE>) is
not implemented or returns <CODE>NO</CODE>, the runtime then tries the
forwarding hook.
</P><P>

Support for <CODE>+resolveInstanceMethod:</CODE> and
<CODE>resolveClassMethod:</CODE> was added to the GNU Objective-C runtime in
GCC version 4.6.

</TR></TABLE>
<H3> 8.10.2 Forwarding hook </H3>
<!--docid::SEC169::-->
<P>

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a hook, called
<CODE>__objc_msg_forward2</CODE>, which is called by
<CODE>objc_msg_lookup()</CODE> when it can't find a method implementation in
the runtime tables and after calling <CODE>+resolveInstanceMethod:</CODE>
and <CODE>+resolveClassMethod:</CODE> has been attempted and did not succeed
in dynamically registering the method.
</P><P>

To configure the hook, you set the global variable
<CODE>__objc_msg_foward2</CODE> to a function with the same argument and
return types of <CODE>objc_msg_lookup()</CODE>.  When
<CODE>objc_msg_lookup()</CODE> can not find a method implementation, it
invokes the hook function you provided to get a method implementation
to return.  So, in practice <CODE>__objc_msg_forward2</CODE> allows you to
extend <CODE>objc_msg_lookup()</CODE> by adding some custom code that is
called to do a further lookup when no standard method implementation
can be found using the normal lookup.
</P><P>

This hook is generally reserved for "Foundation" libraries such as
GNUstep Base, which use it to implement their high-level method
forwarding API, typically based around the <CODE>forwardInvocation:</CODE>
method.  So, unless you are implementing your own "Foundation"
library, you should not set this hook.
</P><P>

In a typical forwarding implementation, the <CODE>__objc_msg_forward2</CODE>
hook function determines the argument and return type of the method
that is being looked up, and then creates a function that takes these
arguments and has that return type, and returns it to the caller.
Creating this function is non-trivial and is typically performed using
a dedicated library such as <CODE>libffi</CODE>.
</P><P>

The forwarding method implementation thus created is returned by
<CODE>objc_msg_lookup()</CODE> and is executed as if it was a normal method
implementation.  When the forwarding method implementation is called,
it is usually expected to pack all arguments into some sort of object
(typically, an <CODE>NSInvocation</CODE> in a "Foundation" library), and
hand it over to the programmer (<CODE>forwardInvocation:</CODE>) who is then
allowed to manipulate the method invocation using a high-level API
provided by the "Foundation" library.  For example, the programmer
may want to examine the method invocation arguments and name and
potentially change them before forwarding the method invocation to one
or more local objects (<CODE>performInvocation:</CODE>) or even to remote
objects (by using Distributed Objects or some other mechanism).  When
all this completes, the return value is passed back and must be
returned correctly to the original caller.
</P><P>

Note that the GNU Objective-C runtime currently provides no support
for method forwarding or method invocations other than the
<CODE>__objc_msg_forward2</CODE> hook.
</P><P>

If the forwarding hook does not exist or returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the
runtime currently attempts forwarding using an older, deprecated API,
and if that fails, it aborts the program.  In future versions of the
GNU Objective-C runtime, the runtime will immediately abort.

<H1> 9. Binary Compatibility </H1>
<!--docid::SEC170::-->
<P>

Binary compatibility encompasses several related concepts:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>application binary interface (ABI)</EM>
<DD>The set of runtime conventions followed by all of the tools that deal
with binary representations of a program, including compilers, assemblers,
linkers, and language runtime support.
Some ABIs are formal with a written specification, possibly designed
by multiple interested parties.  Others are simply the way things are
actually done by a particular set of tools.
<P>

<DT><EM>ABI conformance</EM>
<DD>A compiler conforms to an ABI if it generates code that follows all of
the specifications enumerated by that ABI.
A library conforms to an ABI if it is implemented according to that ABI.
An application conforms to an ABI if it is built using tools that conform
to that ABI and does not contain source code that specifically changes
behavior specified by the ABI.
<P>

<DT><EM>calling conventions</EM>
<DD>Calling conventions are a subset of an ABI that specify of how arguments
are passed and function results are returned.
<P>

<DT><EM>interoperability</EM>
<DD>Different sets of tools are interoperable if they generate files that
can be used in the same program.  The set of tools includes compilers,
assemblers, linkers, libraries, header files, startup files, and debuggers.
Binaries produced by different sets of tools are not interoperable unless
they implement the same ABI.  This applies to different versions of the
same tools as well as tools from different vendors.
<P>

<DT><EM>intercallability</EM>
<DD>Whether a function in a binary built by one set of tools can call a
function in a binary built by a different set of tools is a subset
of interoperability.
<P>

<DT><EM>implementation-defined features</EM>
<DD>Language standards include lists of implementation-defined features whose
behavior can vary from one implementation to another.  Some of these
features are normally covered by a platform's ABI and others are not.
The features that are not covered by an ABI generally affect how a
program behaves, but not intercallability.
<P>

<DT><EM>compatibility</EM>
<DD>Conformance to the same ABI and the same behavior of implementation-defined
features are both relevant for compatibility.
</DL>
<P>

The application binary interface implemented by a C or C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
size and alignment of data types
<LI>
layout of structured types
<LI>
calling conventions
<LI>
register usage conventions
<LI>
interfaces for runtime arithmetic support
<LI>
object file formats
</UL>
<P>

In addition, the application binary interface implemented by a C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:
<UL>
<LI>
name mangling
<LI>
exception handling
<LI>
invoking constructors and destructors
<LI>
layout, alignment, and padding of classes
<LI>
layout and alignment of virtual tables
</UL>
<P>

Some GCC compilation options cause the compiler to generate code that
does not conform to the platform's default ABI.  Other options cause
different program behavior for implementation-defined features that are
not covered by an ABI.  These options are provided for consistency with
other compilers that do not follow the platform's default ABI or the
usual behavior of implementation-defined features for the platform.
Be very careful about using such options.
</P><P>

Most platforms have a well-defined ABI that covers C code, but ABIs
that cover C++ functionality are not yet common.
</P><P>

Starting with GCC 3.2, GCC binary conventions for C++ are based on a
written, vendor-neutral C++ ABI that was designed to be specific to
64-bit Itanium but also includes generic specifications that apply to
any platform.
This C++ ABI is also implemented by other compiler vendors on some
platforms, notably GNU/Linux and BSD systems.
We have tried hard to provide a stable ABI that will be compatible with
future GCC releases, but it is possible that we will encounter problems
that make this difficult.  Such problems could include different
interpretations of the C++ ABI by different vendors, bugs in the ABI, or
bugs in the implementation of the ABI in different compilers.
GCC's <SAMP>`-Wabi'</SAMP> switch warns when G++ generates code that is
probably not compatible with the C++ ABI.
</P><P>

The C++ library used with a C++ compiler includes the Standard C++
Library, with functionality defined in the C++ Standard, plus language
runtime support.  The runtime support is included in a C++ ABI, but there
is no formal ABI for the Standard C++ Library.  Two implementations
of that library are interoperable if one follows the de-facto ABI of the
other and if they are both built with the same compiler, or with compilers
that conform to the same ABI for C++ compiler and runtime support.
</P><P>

When G++ and another C++ compiler conform to the same C++ ABI, but the
implementations of the Standard C++ Library that they normally use do not
follow the same ABI for the Standard C++ Library, object files built with
those compilers can be used in the same program only if they use the same
C++ library.  This requires specifying the location of the C++ library
header files when invoking the compiler whose usual library is not being
used.  The location of GCC's C++ header files depends on how the GCC
build was configured, but can be seen by using the G++ <SAMP>`-v'</SAMP> option.
With default configuration options for G++ 3.3 the compile line for a
different C++ compiler needs to include
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>    -I<VAR>gcc_install_directory</VAR>/include/c++/3.3
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Similarly, compiling code with G++ that must use a C++ library other
than the GNU C++ library requires specifying the location of the header
files for that other library.
</P><P>

The most straightforward way to link a program to use a particular
C++ library is to use a C++ driver that specifies that C++ library by
default.  The <CODE>g++</CODE> driver, for example, tells the linker where
to find GCC's C++ library (<TT>`libstdc++'</TT>) plus the other libraries
and startup files it needs, in the proper order.
</P><P>

If a program must use a different C++ library and it's not possible
to do the final link using a C++ driver that uses that library by default,
it is necessary to tell <CODE>g++</CODE> the location and name of that
library.  It might also be necessary to specify different startup files
and other runtime support libraries, and to suppress the use of GCC's
support libraries with one or more of the options <SAMP>`-nostdlib'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-nostartfiles'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-nodefaultlibs'</SAMP>.

<H2> 10.1 Introduction to <CODE>gcov</CODE> </H2>
<!--docid::SEC172::-->
<P>

<CODE>gcov</CODE> is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GCC
to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running
code and to discover untested parts of your program.  You can use
<CODE>gcov</CODE> as a profiling tool to help discover where your
optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also use
<CODE>gcov</CODE> along with the other profiling tool, <CODE>gprof</CODE>, to
assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing
time.
</P><P>

Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a
profiler such as <CODE>gcov</CODE> or <CODE>gprof</CODE>, you can find out some
basic performance statistics, such as:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
how often each line of code executes
<P>

<LI>
what lines of code are actually executed
<P>

<LI>
how much computing time each section of code uses
</UL>
<P>

Once you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you
can look at each module to see which modules should be optimized.
<CODE>gcov</CODE> helps you determine where to work on optimization.
</P><P>

Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release.
Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage
program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the
testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need
to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a better
final product.
</P><P>

You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use
<CODE>gcov</CODE> because the optimization, by combining some lines of code
into one function, may not give you as much information as you need to
look for `hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer
time.  Likewise, because <CODE>gcov</CODE> accumulates statistics by line (at
the lowest resolution), it works best with a programming style that
places only one statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros
that expand to loops or to other control structures, the statistics are
less helpful--they only report on the line where the macro call
appears.  If your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace
them with inline functions to solve this problem.
</P><P>

<CODE>gcov</CODE> creates a logfile called <TT>`<VAR>sourcefile</VAR>.gcov'</TT> which
indicates how many times each line of a source file <TT>`<VAR>sourcefile</VAR>.c'</TT>
has executed.  You can use these logfiles along with <CODE>gprof</CODE> to aid
in fine-tuning the performance of your programs.  <CODE>gprof</CODE> gives
timing information you can use along with the information you get from
<CODE>gcov</CODE>.
</P><P>

<CODE>gcov</CODE> works only on code compiled with GCC.  It is not
compatible with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.

<CODE>gcov</CODE> accepts the following options:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-h</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>Display help about using <CODE>gcov</CODE> (on the standard output), and
exit without doing any further processing.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--version</CODE>
<DD>Display the <CODE>gcov</CODE> version number (on the standard output),
and exit without doing any further processing.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--all-blocks</CODE>
<DD>Write individual execution counts for every basic block.  Normally gcov
outputs execution counts only for the main blocks of a line.  With this
option you can determine if blocks within a single line are not being
executed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--branch-probabilities</CODE>
<DD>Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch summary
info to the standard output.  This option allows you to see how often
each branch in your program was taken.  Unconditional branches will not
be shown, unless the <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> option is given.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--branch-counts</CODE>
<DD>Write branch frequencies as the number of branches taken, rather than
the percentage of branches taken.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--no-output</CODE>
<DD>Do not create the <CODE>gcov</CODE> output file.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--long-file-names</CODE>
<DD>Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if the
header file <TT>`x.h'</TT> contains code, and was included in the file
<TT>`a.c'</TT>, then running <CODE>gcov</CODE> on the file <TT>`a.c'</TT> will
produce an output file called <TT>`a.c##x.h.gcov'</TT> instead of
<TT>`x.h.gcov'</TT>.  This can be useful if <TT>`x.h'</TT> is included in
multiple source files and you want to see the individual
contributions.  If you use the <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> option, both the including
and included file names will be complete path names.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--preserve-paths</CODE>
<DD>Preserve complete path information in the names of generated
<TT>`.gcov'</TT> files.  Without this option, just the filename component is
used.  With this option, all directories are used, with <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> characters
translated to <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> characters, <TT>`.'</TT> directory components
removed and unremoveable <TT>`..'</TT>
components renamed to <SAMP>`^'</SAMP>.  This is useful if sourcefiles are in several
different directories.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--relative-only</CODE>
<DD>Only output information about source files with a relative pathname
(after source prefix elision).  Absolute paths are usually system
header files and coverage of any inline functions therein is normally
uninteresting.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--function-summaries</CODE>
<DD>Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level summary.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>directory|file</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--object-directory <VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--object-file <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specify either the directory containing the gcov data files, or the
object path name.  The <TT>`.gcno'</TT>, and
<TT>`.gcda'</TT> data files are searched for using this option.  If a directory
is specified, the data files are in that directory and named after the
input file name, without its extension.  If a file is specified here,
the data files are named after that file, without its extension.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-s <VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--source-prefix <VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>A prefix for source file names to remove when generating the output
coverage files.  This option is useful when building in a separate
directory, and the pathname to the source directory is not wanted when
determining the output file names.  Note that this prefix detection is
applied before determining whether the source file is absolute.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-u</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--unconditional-branches</CODE>
<DD>When branch probabilities are given, include those of unconditional branches.
Unconditional branches are normally not interesting.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--display-progress</CODE>
<DD>Display the progress on the standard output.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

<CODE>gcov</CODE> should be run with the current directory the same as that
when you invoked the compiler.  Otherwise it will not be able to locate
the source files.  <CODE>gcov</CODE> produces files called
<TT>`<VAR>mangledname</VAR>.gcov'</TT> in the current directory.  These contain
the coverage information of the source file they correspond to.
One <TT>`.gcov'</TT> file is produced for each source (or header) file
containing code,
which was compiled to produce the data files.  The <VAR>mangledname</VAR> part
of the output file name is usually simply the source file name, but can
be something more complicated if the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> options are
given.  Refer to those options for details.
</P><P>

If you invoke <CODE>gcov</CODE> with multiple input files, the
contributions from each input file are summed.  Typically you would
invoke it with the same list of files as the final link of your executable.
</P><P>

The <TT>`.gcov'</TT> files contain the <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> separated fields along with
program source code.  The format is
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre><VAR>execution_count</VAR>:<VAR>line_number</VAR>:<VAR>source line text</VAR>
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested by
command line option.  The <VAR>execution_count</VAR> is <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> for lines
containing no code.  Unexecuted lines are marked <SAMP>`#####'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`===='</SAMP>, depending on whether they are reachable by
non-exceptional paths or only exceptional paths such as C++ exception
handlers, respectively.
</P><P>

Some lines of information at the start have <VAR>line_number</VAR> of zero.
These preamble lines are of the form
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>-:0:<VAR>tag</VAR>:<VAR>value</VAR>
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be augmented as
<CODE>gcov</CODE> development progresses -- do not rely on them remaining
unchanged.  Use <VAR>tag</VAR> to locate a particular preamble line.
</P><P>

The additional block information is of the form
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre><VAR>tag</VAR> <VAR>information</VAR>
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <VAR>information</VAR> is human readable, but designed to be simple
enough for machine parsing too.
</P><P>

When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the values
are <EM>exactly</EM> 0% and 100% respectively.  Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as the
nearest non-boundary value.
</P><P>

When using <CODE>gcov</CODE>, you must first compile your program with two
special GCC options: <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage'</SAMP>.
This tells the compiler to generate additional information needed by
gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes
additional code in the object files for generating the extra profiling
information needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the
directory where the object file is located.
</P><P>

Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>, an accompanying
<TT>`.gcda'</TT> file will be placed in the object file directory.
</P><P>

Running <CODE>gcov</CODE> with your program's source file names as arguments
will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
for each line.  For example, if your program is called <TT>`tmp.c'</TT>, this
is what you see when you use the basic <CODE>gcov</CODE> facility:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage tmp.c
$ a.out
$ gcov tmp.c
90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c
Creating tmp.c.gcov.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The file <TT>`tmp.c.gcov'</TT> contains output from <CODE>gcov</CODE>.
Here is a sample:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>        -:    0:Source:tmp.c

        1:    7:  total = 0;
        -:    8:
       11:    9:  for (i = 0; i &#60; 10; i++)
       10:   10:    total += i;

        1:   16:  return 0;
        -:   17:}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

When you use the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> option, you will get individual block
counts, and the output looks like this:
</P><P>

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this mode, each basic block is only shown on one line -- the last
line of the block.  A multi-line block will only contribute to the
execution count of that last line, and other lines will not be shown
to contain code, unless previous blocks end on those lines.
The total execution count of a line is shown and subsequent lines show
the execution counts for individual blocks that end on that line.  After each
block, the branch and call counts of the block will be shown, if the
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option is given.
</P><P>

Because of the way GCC instruments calls, a call count can be shown
after a line with no individual blocks.
As you can see, line 13 contains a basic block that was not executed.
</P><P>

When you use the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option, your output looks like this:
</P><P>

For each function, a line is printed showing how many times the function
is called, how many times it returns and what percentage of the
function's blocks were executed.
</P><P>

For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the basic
block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.  There can
be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case, the
branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way to map
these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general, though,
the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct
on the source line.
</P><P>

For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message "never executed" is printed.
</P><P>

For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions that call <CODE>exit</CODE> or <CODE>longjmp</CODE>,
and thus may not return every time they are called.
</P><P>

The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the <TT>`.gcda'</TT> file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.
</P><P>

The data in the <TT>`.gcda'</TT> files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>, the
profiling code first attempts to read in an existing <TT>`.gcda'</TT> file; if
the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
counts) it will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
new execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.

<H2> 10.3 Using <CODE>gcov</CODE> with GCC Optimization </H2>
<!--docid::SEC174::-->
<P>

If you plan to use <CODE>gcov</CODE> to help optimize your code, you must
first compile your program with two special GCC options:
<SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage'</SAMP>.  Aside from that, you can use any
other GCC options; but if you want to prove that every single line
in your program was executed, you should not compile with optimization
at the same time.  On some machines the optimizer can eliminate some
simple code lines by combining them with other lines.  For example, code
like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>if (a != b)
  c = 1;
else
  c = 0;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In this case,
there is no way for <CODE>gcov</CODE> to calculate separate execution counts
for each line because there isn't separate code for each line.  Hence
the <CODE>gcov</CODE> output looks like this if you compiled the program with
optimization:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>      100:   12:if (a != b)
      100:   13:  c = 1;
      100:   14:else
      100:   15:  c = 0;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The output shows that this block of code, combined by optimization,
executed 100 times.  In one sense this result is correct, because there
was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.  However,
the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
many times the result was 1.
</P><P>

Inlineable functions can create unexpected line counts.  Line counts are
shown for the source code of the inlineable function, but what is shown
depends on where the function is inlined, or if it is not inlined at all.
</P><P>

If the function is not inlined, the compiler must emit an out of line
copy of the function, in any object file that needs it.  If
<TT>`fileA.o'</TT> and <TT>`fileB.o'</TT> both contain out of line bodies of a
particular inlineable function, they will also both contain coverage
counts for that function.  When <TT>`fileA.o'</TT> and <TT>`fileB.o'</TT> are
linked together, the linker will, on many systems, select one of those
out of line bodies for all calls to that function, and remove or ignore
the other.  Unfortunately, it will not remove the coverage counters for
the unused function body.  Hence when instrumented, all but one use of
that function will show zero counts.
</P><P>

If the function is inlined in several places, the block structure in
each location might not be the same.  For instance, a condition might
now be calculable at compile time in some instances.  Because the
coverage of all the uses of the inline function will be shown for the
same source lines, the line counts themselves might seem inconsistent.

<H2> 10.4 Brief description of <CODE>gcov</CODE> data files </H2>
<!--docid::SEC175::-->
<P>

<CODE>gcov</CODE> uses two files for profiling.  The names of these files
are derived from the original <EM>object</EM> file by substituting the
file suffix with either <TT>`.gcno'</TT>, or <TT>`.gcda'</TT>.  All of these files
are placed in the same directory as the object file, and contain data
stored in a platform-independent format.
</P><P>

The <TT>`.gcno'</TT> file is generated when the source file is compiled with
the GCC <SAMP>`-ftest-coverage'</SAMP> option.  It contains information to
reconstruct the basic block graphs and assign source line numbers to
blocks.
</P><P>

The <TT>`.gcda'</TT> file is generated when a program containing object files
built with the GCC <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP> option is executed.  A
separate <TT>`.gcda'</TT> file is created for each object file compiled with
this option.  It contains arc transition counts, and some summary
information.
</P><P>

The full details of the file format is specified in <TT>`gcov-io.h'</TT>,
and functions provided in that header file should be used to access the
coverage files.

<H2> 10.5 Data file relocation to support cross-profiling </H2>
<!--docid::SEC176::-->
<P>

Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>, an accompanying <TT>`.gcda'</TT>
file will be placed in the object file directory. That implicitly requires
running the program on the same system as it was built or having the same
absolute directory structure on the target system. The program will try
to create the needed directory structure, if it is not already present.
</P><P>

To support cross-profiling, a program compiled with <SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>
can relocate the data files based on two environment variables:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
GCOV_PREFIX contains the prefix to add to the absolute paths
in the object file. Prefix can be absolute, or relative.  The
default is no prefix.
<P>

<LI>
GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP indicates the how many initial directory names to strip off
the hardwired absolute paths. Default value is 0.
<P>

<EM>Note:</EM> If GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP is set without GCOV_PREFIX is undefined,
 then a relative path is made out of the hardwired absolute paths.
</UL>
<P>

For example, if the object file <TT>`/user/build/foo.o'</TT> was built with
<SAMP>`-fprofile-arcs'</SAMP>, the final executable will try to create the data file
<TT>`/user/build/foo.gcda'</TT> when running on the target system.  This will
fail if the corresponding directory does not exist and it is unable to create
it.  This can be overcome by, for example, setting the environment as
<SAMP>`GCOV_PREFIX=/target/run'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP=1'</SAMP>.  Such a
setting will name the data file <TT>`/target/run/build/foo.gcda'</TT>.
</P><P>

You must move the data files to the expected directory tree in order to
use them for profile directed optimizations (<SAMP>`--use-profile'</SAMP>), or to
use the <CODE>gcov</CODE> tool.

<H2> 11.3 Interoperation </H2>
<!--docid::SEC180::-->
<P>

This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GCC
together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers,
libraries and debuggers on certain systems.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
On many platforms, GCC supports a different ABI for C++ than do other
compilers, so the object files compiled by GCC cannot be used with object
files generated by another C++ compiler.
<P>

An area where the difference is most apparent is name mangling.  The use
of different name mangling is intentional, to protect you from more subtle
problems.
Compilers differ as to many internal details of C++ implementation,
including: how class instances are laid out, how multiple inheritance is
implemented, and how virtual function calls are handled.  If the name
encoding were made the same, your programs would link against libraries
provided from other compilers--but the programs would then crash when
run.  Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
at run time.
</P><P>

<LI>
On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of profiling
causes static variable destructors (currently used only in C++) not to
be run.
<P>

<LI>
On some SGI systems, when you use <SAMP>`-lgl_s'</SAMP> as an option,
it gets translated magically to <SAMP>`-lgl_s -lX11_s -lc_s'</SAMP>.
Naturally, this does not happen when you use GCC.
You must specify all three options explicitly.
<P>

<LI>
On a SPARC, GCC aligns all values of type <CODE>double</CODE> on an 8-byte
boundary, and it expects every <CODE>double</CODE> to be so aligned.  The Sun
compiler usually gives <CODE>double</CODE> values 8-byte alignment, with one
exception: function arguments of type <CODE>double</CODE> may not be aligned.
<P>

As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address of an
argument of type <CODE>double</CODE> and passes this pointer of type
<CODE>double *</CODE> to a function compiled with GCC, dereferencing the
pointer may cause a fatal signal.
</P><P>

One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program with GCC.
Another solution is to modify the function that is compiled with
Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable; local variables
are always properly aligned.  A third solution is to modify the function
that uses the pointer to dereference it via the following function
<CODE>access_double</CODE> instead of directly with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>inline double
access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
{
  union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };

  union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
  union d2i u;

  u.i[0] = p-&#62;i[0];
  u.i[1] = p-&#62;i[1];

  return u.d;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.
</P><P>

<LI>
On Solaris, the <CODE>malloc</CODE> function in the <TT>`libmalloc.a'</TT> library
may allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GCC on the
SPARC assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
<TT>`libmalloc.a'</TT> library.
<P>

The solution is to not use the <TT>`libmalloc.a'</TT> library.  Use instead
<CODE>malloc</CODE> and related functions from <TT>`libc.a'</TT>; they do not have
this problem.
</P><P>

<LI>
On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions compiled
with GCC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions that use
<CODE>alloca</CODE> or variable-size arrays.  This is because GCC doesn't
generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It may even be
impossible to generate them.
<P>

<LI>
Debugging (<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>) is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you use
the preliminary GNU tools.
<P>

<LI>
Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX
PA assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.
<P>

<LI>
Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static functions
will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply is no way for GCC
to specify what registers hold arguments for static functions when using
the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.
<P>

<LI>
In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
receive errors from the HP linker complaining about an out of bounds
unconditional branch offset.  This used to occur more often in previous
versions of GCC, but is now exceptionally rare.  If you should run
into it, you can work around by making your function smaller.
<P>

<LI>
GCC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX assembler of
the form:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>(warning) Use of GR3 when
  frame &#62;= 8192 may cause conflict.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.
</P><P>

<LI>
In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
receive errors from the AIX Assembler complaining about a displacement
that is too large.  If you should run into it, you can work around by
making your function smaller.
<P>

<LI>
The <TT>`libstdc++.a'</TT> library in GCC relies on the SVR4 dynamic
linker semantics which merges global symbols between libraries and
applications, especially necessary for C++ streams functionality.
This is not the default behavior of AIX shared libraries and dynamic
linking.  <TT>`libstdc++.a'</TT> is built on AIX with "runtime-linking"
enabled so that symbol merging can occur.  To utilize this feature,
the application linked with <TT>`libstdc++.a'</TT> must include the
<SAMP>`-Wl,-brtl'</SAMP> flag on the link line.  G++ cannot impose this
because this option may interfere with the semantics of the user
program and users may not always use <SAMP>`g++'</SAMP> to link his or her
application.  Applications are not required to use the
<SAMP>`-Wl,-brtl'</SAMP> flag on the link line--the rest of the
<TT>`libstdc++.a'</TT> library which is not dependent on the symbol
merging semantics will continue to function correctly.
<P>

<LI>
An application can interpose its own definition of functions for
functions invoked by <TT>`libstdc++.a'</TT> with "runtime-linking"
enabled on AIX.  To accomplish this the application must be linked
with "runtime-linking" option and the functions explicitly must be
exported by the application (<SAMP>`-Wl,-brtl,-bE:exportfile'</SAMP>).
<P>

<LI>
AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside of
the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
locale-specific representations of various objects including
floating-point numbers (<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> vs <SAMP>`,'</SAMP> for separating decimal
fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library linked
with GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the
assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set the <CODE>LANG</CODE>
environment variable to <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`En_US'</SAMP>.
<P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1507"></A>
Even if you specify <SAMP>`-fdollars-in-identifiers'</SAMP>,
you cannot successfully use <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifiers on the RS/6000 due
to a restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these
identifiers.

Another consequence is that <CODE>sscanf</CODE> does not work on some very
old systems when passed a string constant as its format control string
or input.  This is because <CODE>sscanf</CODE> incorrectly tries to write
into the string constant.  Likewise <CODE>fscanf</CODE> and <CODE>scanf</CODE>.
</P><P>

The solution to these problems is to change the program to use
<CODE>char</CODE>-array variables with initialization strings for these
purposes instead of string constants.
</P><P>

<LI>
<CODE>-2147483648</CODE> is positive.
<P>

This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type <CODE>int</CODE>, so
(following the ISO C rules) its data type is <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE>.
Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.
</P><P>

<LI>
GCC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
string constants.  For example, the following macro in GCC
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#define foo(a) "a"
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will produce output <CODE>"a"</CODE> regardless of what the argument <VAR>a</VAR> is.

<LI>
When you use <CODE>setjmp</CODE> and <CODE>longjmp</CODE>, the only automatic
variables guaranteed to remain valid are those declared
<CODE>volatile</CODE>.  This is a consequence of automatic register
allocation.  Consider this function:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>jmp_buf j;

foo ()
{
  int a, b;

  a = fun1 ();
  if (setjmp (j))
    return a;

  a = fun2 ();
  /* <CODE>longjmp (j)</CODE> may occur in <CODE>fun3</CODE>. */
  return a + fun3 ();
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>a</CODE> may or may not be restored to its first value when the
<CODE>longjmp</CODE> occurs.  If <CODE>a</CODE> is allocated in a register, then
its first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
in it.
</P><P>

If you use the <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP> option with the <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option, you will
get a warning when GCC thinks such a problem might be possible.
</P><P>

<LI>
Programs that use preprocessing directives in the middle of macro
arguments do not work with GCC.  For example, a program like this
will not work:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>foobar (
#define luser
        hack)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

ISO C does not permit such a construct.

Declarations of external variables and functions within a block apply
only to the block containing the declaration.  In other words, they
have the same scope as any other declaration in the same place.

In some other C compilers, an <CODE>extern</CODE> declaration affects all the
rest of the file even if it happens within a block.

In traditional C, you can combine <CODE>long</CODE>, etc., with a typedef name,
as shown here:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>typedef int foo;
typedef long foo bar;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In ISO C, this is not allowed: <CODE>long</CODE> and other type modifiers
require an explicit <CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1521"></A>

PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.
<P>

<LI>
Traditional C allows the following erroneous pair of declarations to
appear together in a given scope:

GCC treats all characters of identifiers as significant.  According to
K&#38;R-1 (2.2), "No more than the first eight characters are significant,
although more may be used.".  Also according to K&R-1 (2.2), "An
identifier is a sequence of letters and digits; the first character must
be a letter.  The underscore _ counts as a letter.", but GCC also
allows dollar signs in identifiers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1522"></A>
<LI>
PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment operators
such as <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>.  GCC, following the ISO standard, does not
allow this.
<P>

GCC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
preprocessing conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if these
comments contain apostrophes, GCC will probably report an error.  For
example, this code would produce an error:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#if 0
You can't expect this to work.
#endif
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an actual
C comment delimited by <SAMP>`/*<small>...</small>*/'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<LI>
Many user programs contain the declaration <SAMP>`long time ();'</SAMP>.  In the
past, the system header files on many systems did not actually declare
<CODE>time</CODE>, so it did not matter what type your program declared it to
return.  But in systems with ISO C headers, <CODE>time</CODE> is declared to
return <CODE>time_t</CODE>, and if that is not the same as <CODE>long</CODE>, then
<SAMP>`long time ();'</SAMP> is erroneous.
<P>

The solution is to change your program to use appropriate system headers
(<CODE>&#60;time.h&#62;</CODE> on systems with ISO C headers) and not to declare
<CODE>time</CODE> if the system header files declare it, or failing that to
use <CODE>time_t</CODE> as the return type of <CODE>time</CODE>.
</P><P>

When compiling functions that return <CODE>float</CODE>, PCC converts it to
a double.  GCC actually returns a <CODE>float</CODE>.  If you are concerned
with PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
<CODE>double</CODE>; you might as well say what you mean.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1526"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1527"></A>
<LI>
When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GCC
output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GCC cannot call
a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.
<P>

The method used by GCC is as follows: a structure or union which is
1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or union
with any other size is stored into an address supplied by the caller
(usually in a special, fixed register, but on some machines it is passed
on the stack).  The target hook <CODE>TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX</CODE>
tells GCC where to pass this address.
</P><P>

By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value.
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  GCC does not use this method because it is
slower and nonreentrant.
</P><P>

On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
structure and union returning.  GCC on most of these machines uses a
compatible convention when returning structures and unions in memory,
but still returns small structures and unions in registers.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1528"></A>
You can tell GCC to use a compatible convention for all structure and
union returning with the option <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>.

GCC complains about program fragments such as <SAMP>`0x74ae-0x4000'</SAMP>
which appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
operator.  Actually, this string is a single <EM>preprocessing token</EM>.
Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this does not,
GCC prints an error message.  Although it may appear obvious that what
is meant is an operator and two values, the ISO C standard specifically
requires that this be treated as erroneous.
<P>

A <EM>preprocessing token</EM> is a <EM>preprocessing number</EM> if it
begins with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
periods and <SAMP>`e+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`e-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`E+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`E-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`p+'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`p-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`P+'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`P-'</SAMP> character sequences.  (In strict C90
mode, the sequences <SAMP>`p+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`p-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`P+'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`P-'</SAMP> cannot
appear in preprocessing numbers.)
</P><P>

To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in front of
the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the preprocessing number.

<H2> 11.5 Fixed Header Files </H2>
<!--docid::SEC182::-->
<P>

GCC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files.
This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
work with GCC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
incompatible with ISO C, and some depend on special features of other
compilers.
</P><P>

Installing GCC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called <CODE>fixincludes</CODE>.  Normally, you
don't need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it
doesn't do the right thing automatically.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a new
system version, the fixed header files of GCC are not automatically
updated.  They can be updated using the <CODE>mkheaders</CODE> script
installed in
<TT>`<VAR>libexecdir</VAR>/gcc/<VAR>target</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>/install-tools/'</TT>.
<P>

<LI>
On some systems, header file directories contain
machine-specific symbolic links in certain places.  This makes it
possible to share most of the header files among hosts running the
same version of the system on different machine models.
<P>

The programs that fix the header files do not understand this special
way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of fixed header
files is good only for the machine model used to build it.
</P><P>

It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic links so
as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by hand.

GCC by itself attempts to be a conforming freestanding implementation.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC2">Language Standards Supported by GCC</A>, for details of
what this means.  Beyond the library facilities required of such an
implementation, the rest of the C library is supplied by the vendor of
the operating system.  If that C library doesn't conform to the C
standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when using
<SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>) that you don't expect.
</P><P>

For example, the <CODE>sprintf</CODE> function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns
<CODE>char *</CODE> while the C standard says that <CODE>sprintf</CODE> returns an
<CODE>int</CODE>.  The <CODE>fixincludes</CODE> program could make the prototype for
this function match the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the
function will still return <CODE>char *</CODE>.
</P><P>

If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as
GCC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called <CODE>glibc</CODE>)
provides ISO C, POSIX, BSD, SystemV and X/Open compatibility for
GNU/Linux and HURD-based GNU systems; no recent version of it supports
other systems, though some very old versions did.  Version 2.2 of the
GNU C library includes nearly complete C99 support.  You could also ask
your operating system vendor if newer libraries are available.

<!--docid::SEC184::-->
<P>

These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any practical
way around them.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you compile
with optimization.
<P>

This occurs because sometimes GCC optimizes the variable out of
existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
value such a variable "would have had", and it is not clear that would
be desirable anyway.  So GCC simply does not mention the eliminated
variable when it writes debugging information.
</P><P>

You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
executable and your source code, when you use optimization.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1532"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1533"></A>
<LI>
Users often think it is a bug when GCC reports an error for code
like this:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int foo (struct mumble *);

struct mumble { <small>...</small> };

int foo (struct mumble *x)
{ <small>...</small> }
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This code really is erroneous, because the scope of <CODE>struct
mumble</CODE> in the prototype is limited to the argument list containing it.
It does not refer to the <CODE>struct mumble</CODE> defined with file scope
immediately below--they are two unrelated types with similar names in
different scopes.
</P><P>

But in the definition of <CODE>foo</CODE>, the file-scope type is used
because that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition and
the prototype do not match, and you get an error.
</P><P>

This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ISO standard specifies.
It is easy enough for you to make your code work by moving the
definition of <CODE>struct mumble</CODE> above the prototype.  It's not worth
being incompatible with ISO C just to avoid an error for the example
shown above.
</P><P>

<LI>
Accesses to bit-fields even in volatile objects works by accessing larger
objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what size of
object is accessed in order to read or write the bit-field; it may even
vary for a given bit-field according to the precise usage.
<P>

If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is accessed, use
volatile but do not use bit-fields.
</P><P>

<LI>
GCC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in system
header files.  They install corrected copies of various header files in
a special directory where only GCC will normally look for them.  The
scripts adapt to various systems by searching all the system header
files for the problem cases that we know about.
<P>

If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically arranges
to update the corrected header files.  They can be updated using the
<CODE>mkheaders</CODE> script installed in
<TT>`<VAR>libexecdir</VAR>/gcc/<VAR>target</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>/install-tools/'</TT>.
</P><P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1534"></A>
On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical results
if you test the precise values of floating point numbers.  For example,
you can find that a floating point value which is not a NaN is not equal
to itself.  This results from the fact that the floating point registers
hold a few more bits of precision than fit in a <CODE>double</CODE> in memory.
Compiled code moves values between memory and floating point registers
at its convenience, and moving them into memory truncates them.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1535"></A>
You can partially avoid this problem by using the <SAMP>`-ffloat-store'</SAMP>
option (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC18">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</A>).
</P><P>

<LI>
On AIX and other platforms without weak symbol support, templates
need to be instantiated explicitly and symbols for static members
of templates will not be generated.
<P>

<LI>
On AIX, GCC scans object files and library archives for static
constructors and destructors when linking an application before the
linker prunes unreferenced symbols.  This is necessary to prevent the
AIX linker from mistakenly assuming that static constructor or
destructor are unused and removing them before the scanning can occur.
All static constructors and destructors found will be referenced even
though the modules in which they occur may not be used by the program.
This may lead to both increased executable size and unexpected symbol
references.

When a class has static data members, it is not enough to <EM>declare</EM>
the static member; you must also <EM>define</EM> it.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>class Foo
{
  <small>...</small>
  void method();
  static int bar;
};
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This declaration only establishes that the class <CODE>Foo</CODE> has an
<CODE>int</CODE> named <CODE>Foo::bar</CODE>, and a member function named
<CODE>Foo::method</CODE>.  But you still need to define <EM>both</EM>
<CODE>method</CODE> and <CODE>bar</CODE> elsewhere.  According to the ISO
standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and only one) source
file, such as:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>int Foo::bar = 0;
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Other C++ compilers may not correctly implement the standard behavior.
As a result, when you switch to <CODE>g++</CODE> from one of these compilers,
you may discover that a program that appeared to work correctly in fact
does not conform to the standard: <CODE>g++</CODE> reports as undefined
symbols any static data members that lack definitions.

<H3> 11.8.2 Name lookup, templates, and accessing members of base classes </H3>
<!--docid::SEC187::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1543"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1544"></A>

</P><P>

The C++ standard prescribes that all names that are not dependent on
template parameters are bound to their present definitions when parsing
a template function or class.<A NAME="DOCF5" HREF="gcc.html#FOOT5">(5)</A>  Only names that are dependent are looked up at the point
of instantiation.  For example, consider
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  void foo(double);

  struct A {
    template &#60;typename T&#62;
    void f () {
      foo (1);        // 1
      int i = N;      // 2
      T t;
      t.bar();        // 3
      foo (t);        // 4
    }

    static const int N;
  };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here, the names <CODE>foo</CODE> and <CODE>N</CODE> appear in a context that does
not depend on the type of <CODE>T</CODE>.  The compiler will thus require that
they are defined in the context of use in the template, not only before
the point of instantiation, and will here use <CODE>::foo(double)</CODE> and
<CODE>A::N</CODE>, respectively.  In particular, it will convert the integer
value to a <CODE>double</CODE> when passing it to <CODE>::foo(double)</CODE>.
</P><P>

Conversely, <CODE>bar</CODE> and the call to <CODE>foo</CODE> in the fourth marked
line are used in contexts that do depend on the type of <CODE>T</CODE>, so
they are only looked up at the point of instantiation, and you can
provide declarations for them after declaring the template, but before
instantiating it.  In particular, if you instantiate <CODE>A::f&#60;int&#62;</CODE>,
the last line will call an overloaded <CODE>::foo(int)</CODE> if one was
provided, even if after the declaration of <CODE>struct A</CODE>.
</P><P>

This distinction between lookup of dependent and non-dependent names is
called two-stage (or dependent) name lookup.  G++ implements it
since version 3.4.
</P><P>

Two-stage name lookup sometimes leads to situations with behavior
different from non-template codes.  The most common is probably this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  template &#60;typename T&#62; struct Base {
    int i;
  };

  template &#60;typename T&#62; struct Derived : public Base&#60;T&#62; {
    int get_i() { return i; }
  };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In <CODE>get_i()</CODE>, <CODE>i</CODE> is not used in a dependent context, so the
compiler will look for a name declared at the enclosing namespace scope
(which is the global scope here).  It will not look into the base class,
since that is dependent and you may declare specializations of
<CODE>Base</CODE> even after declaring <CODE>Derived</CODE>, so the compiler can't
really know what <CODE>i</CODE> would refer to.  If there is no global
variable <CODE>i</CODE>, then you will get an error message.
</P><P>

In order to make it clear that you want the member of the base class,
you need to defer lookup until instantiation time, at which the base
class is known.  For this, you need to access <CODE>i</CODE> in a dependent
context, by either using <CODE>this-&#62;i</CODE> (remember that <CODE>this</CODE> is of
type <CODE>Derived&#60;T&#62;*</CODE>, so is obviously dependent), or using
<CODE>Base&#60;T&#62;::i</CODE>.  Alternatively, <CODE>Base&#60;T&#62;::i</CODE> might be brought
into scope by a <CODE>using</CODE>-declaration.
</P><P>

Another, similar example involves calling member functions of a base
class:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  template &#60;typename T&#62; struct Base {
      int f();
  };

  template &#60;typename T&#62; struct Derived : Base&#60;T&#62; {
      int g() { return f(); };
  };
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Again, the call to <CODE>f()</CODE> is not dependent on template arguments
(there are no arguments that depend on the type <CODE>T</CODE>, and it is also
not otherwise specified that the call should be in a dependent context).
Thus a global declaration of such a function must be available, since
the one in the base class is not visible until instantiation time.  The
compiler will consequently produce the following error message:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  x.cc: In member function `int Derived&#60;T&#62;::g()':
  x.cc:6: error: there are no arguments to `f' that depend on a template
     parameter, so a declaration of `f' must be available
  x.cc:6: error: (if you use `-fpermissive', G++ will accept your code, but
     allowing the use of an undeclared name is deprecated)
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

To make the code valid either use <CODE>this-&#62;f()</CODE>, or
<CODE>Base&#60;T&#62;::f()</CODE>.  Using the <SAMP>`-fpermissive'</SAMP> flag will also let
the compiler accept the code, by marking all function calls for which no
declaration is visible at the time of definition of the template for
later lookup at instantiation time, as if it were a dependent call.
We do not recommend using <SAMP>`-fpermissive'</SAMP> to work around invalid
code, and it will also only catch cases where functions in base classes
are called, not where variables in base classes are used (as in the
example above).
</P><P>

Note that some compilers (including G++ versions prior to 3.4) get these
examples wrong and accept above code without an error.  Those compilers
do not implement two-stage name lookup correctly.

<H3> 11.8.3 Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect </H3>
<!--docid::SEC188::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1546"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1547"></A>
It is dangerous to use pointers or references to <EM>portions</EM> of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes,
especially ones that define a conversion function to type <CODE>char *</CODE>
or <CODE>const char *</CODE>---which is one reason why the standard
<CODE>string</CODE> class requires you to call the <CODE>c_str</CODE> member
function.  However, any class that returns a pointer to some internal
structure is potentially subject to this problem.
</P><P>

For example, a program may use a function <CODE>strfunc</CODE> that returns
<CODE>string</CODE> objects, and another function <CODE>charfunc</CODE> that
operates on pointers to <CODE>char</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>string strfunc ();
void charfunc (const char *);

void
f ()
{
  const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
  <small>...</small>
  charfunc (p);
  <small>...</small>
  charfunc (p);
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C
string returned by the <CODE>c_str</CODE> member function and use that rather
than call <CODE>c_str</CODE> repeatedly.  However, the temporary string
created by the call to <CODE>strfunc</CODE> is destroyed after <CODE>p</CODE> is
initialized, at which point <CODE>p</CODE> is left pointing to freed memory.
</P><P>

Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries
along with normal local variables.  However, the GNU C++ behavior is
standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of
temporaries it is not portable.
</P><P>

The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name, which
forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name.  For
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>const string&#38; tmp = strfunc ();
charfunc (tmp.c_str ());

<H3> 11.8.4 Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases </H3>
<!--docid::SEC189::-->
<P>

When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
belongs to each full object.  Also, the constructors and destructors are
invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class.  However, such
objects behave unspecified when being assigned.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>struct Base{
  char *name;
  Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
  Base&#38; operator= (const Base&#38; other){
   free (name);
   name = strdup (other.name);
  }
};

struct A:virtual Base{
  int val;
  A():Base("A"){}
};

struct B:virtual Base{
  int bval;
  B():Base("B"){}
};

struct Derived:public A, public B{
  Derived():Base("Derived"){}
};

void func(Derived &#38;d1, Derived &#38;d2)
{
  d1 = d2;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The C++ standard specifies that <SAMP>`Base::Base'</SAMP> is only called once
when constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object.  It is
unspecified whether <SAMP>`Base::operator='</SAMP> is called more than once when
the implicit copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is
inside <SAMP>`func'</SAMP> in the example).
</P><P>

G++ implements the "intuitive" algorithm for copy-assignment: assign all
direct bases, then assign all members.  In that algorithm, the virtual
base subobject can be encountered more than once.  In the example, copying
proceeds in the following order: <SAMP>`val'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`name'</SAMP> (via
<CODE>strdup</CODE>), <SAMP>`bval'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`name'</SAMP> again.
</P><P>

If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties.  With such an
operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
subobject is assigned.

<H2> 11.9 Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make </H2>
<!--docid::SEC190::-->
<P>

This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
we do not make because we think GCC is better without them.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has an
old-fashioned definition and no prototype.
<P>

Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that appear
in the same file as the called function, following the definition.  The
only way to check all calls reliably is to add a prototype for the
function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the motivation for this
feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.
</P><P>

<LI>
Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift count.
<P>

Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned.
Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.
</P><P>

<LI>
Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.
<P>

Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would cause
more annoyance than good.
</P><P>

<LI>
Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.
<P>

C contains many standard functions that return a value that most
programs choose to ignore.  One obvious example is <CODE>printf</CODE>.
Warning about this practice only leads the defensive programmer to
clutter programs with dozens of casts to <CODE>void</CODE>.  Such casts are
required so frequently that they become visual noise.  Writing those
casts becomes so automatic that they no longer convey useful
information about the intentions of the programmer.  For functions
where the return value should never be ignored, use the
<CODE>warn_unused_result</CODE> function attribute (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC86">6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>).
</P><P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1548"></A>
Making <SAMP>`-fshort-enums'</SAMP> the default.
<P>

This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other C
compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you can get
the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters most is when
the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure, and in that case
you can specify a field width explicitly.
</P><P>

<LI>
Making bit-fields unsigned by default on particular machines where "the
ABI standard" says to do so.
<P>

The ISO C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a bit-field
declared plain <CODE>int</CODE> is signed or not.  This in effect creates two
alternative dialects of C.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1549"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1550"></A>
The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the signed
dialect with <SAMP>`-fsigned-bitfields'</SAMP> and the unsigned dialect with
<SAMP>`-funsigned-bitfields'</SAMP>.  However, this leaves open the question of
which dialect to use by default.
</P><P>

Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bit-fields signed, because
this is simplest.  Since <CODE>int</CODE> is the same as <CODE>signed int</CODE> in
every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in bit-fields
as well.
</P><P>

Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary Interface
standards which specify that plain bit-fields should be unsigned.  It is
a mistake, however, to say anything about this issue in an ABI.  This is
because the handling of plain bit-fields distinguishes two dialects of C.
Both dialects are meaningful on every type of machine.  Whether a
particular object file was compiled using signed bit-fields or unsigned
is of no concern to other object files, even if they access the same
bit-fields in the same data structures.
</P><P>

A given program is written in one or the other of these two dialects.
The program stands a chance to work on most any machine if it is
compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work at all if
compiled with the wrong dialect.
</P><P>

Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bit-fields differently on
certain machines.
</P><P>

Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular machine
type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the GNU C compiler
were to support by default the same dialect as the other compilers on
that machine.  But such applications are rare.  And users writing a
program to run on more than one type of machine cannot possibly benefit
from this kind of compatibility.
</P><P>

This is why GCC does and will treat plain bit-fields in the same
fashion on all types of machines (by default).
</P><P>

There are some arguments for making bit-fields unsigned by default on all
machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de facto standard,
it would make sense for GCC to go along with it.  This is something
to be considered in the future.
</P><P>

(Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should indicate
explicitly in each bit-field whether it is signed or not.  In this way,
they write programs which have the same meaning in both C dialects.)
</P><P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1552"></A>
Undefining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> when <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is not used.
<P>

Currently, GCC defines <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> unconditionally.  This provides
good results in practice.
</P><P>

Programmers normally use conditionals on <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to ask whether
it is safe to use certain features of ISO C, such as function
prototypes or ISO token concatenation.  Since plain <CODE>gcc</CODE> supports
all the features of ISO C, the correct answer to these questions is
"yes".
</P><P>

Some users try to use <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to check for the availability of
certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an ISO
C program, because the ISO C standard says that a conforming
freestanding implementation should define <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> even though it
does not have the library facilities.  <SAMP>`gcc -ansi -pedantic'</SAMP> is a
conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore required to
define <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>, even though it does not come with an ISO C
library.
</P><P>

Sometimes people say that defining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> in a compiler that
does not completely conform to the ISO C standard somehow violates the
standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for compilers
that claim to support ISO C, such as <SAMP>`gcc -ansi'</SAMP>---not for other
compilers such as plain <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  Whatever the ISO C standard says
is relevant to the design of plain <CODE>gcc</CODE> without <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> only
for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.
</P><P>

GCC normally defines <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to be 1, and in addition
defines <CODE>__STRICT_ANSI__</CODE> if you specify the <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option,
or a <SAMP>`-std'</SAMP> option for strict conformance to some version of ISO C.
On some hosts, system include files use a different convention, where
<CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
conformance to the C Standard.  GCC follows the host convention when
processing system include files, but when processing user files it follows
the usual GNU C convention.
</P><P>

<LI>
Undefining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> in C++.
<P>

Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
value of <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> that goes with the C compiler that is
subsequently used.  These programs must test <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>
to determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses:
whether they should concatenate tokens in the ISO C fashion
or in the traditional fashion.
</P><P>

These programs work properly with GNU C++ if <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is defined.
They would not work otherwise.
</P><P>

In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in ISO
C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can work without
change in C++ provided <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is defined.  If <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>
is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to be changed to
test explicitly for C++ as well.
</P><P>

<LI>
Deleting "empty" loops.
<P>

Historically, GCC has not deleted "empty" loops under the
assumption that the most likely reason you would put one in a program is
to have a delay, so deleting them will not make real programs run any
faster.
</P><P>

However, the rationale here is that optimization of a nonempty loop
cannot produce an empty one. This held for carefully written C compiled
with less powerful optimizers but is not always the case for carefully
written C++ or with more powerful optimizers.
Thus GCC will remove operations from loops whenever it can determine
those operations are not externally visible (apart from the time taken
to execute them, of course).  In case the loop can be proved to be finite,
GCC will also remove the loop itself.
</P><P>

Be aware of this when performing timing tests, for instance the
following loop can be completely removed, provided
<CODE>some_expression</CODE> can provably not change any global state.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>{
   int sum = 0;
   int ix;

   for (ix = 0; ix != 10000; ix++)
      sum += some_expression;
}
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Even though <CODE>sum</CODE> is accumulated in the loop, no use is made of
that summation, so the accumulation can be removed.
</P><P>

<LI>
Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other compiler.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1553"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1554"></A>
It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side effects.
For example, a function call like this may very well behave differently
from one compiler to another:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>void func (int, int);

int i = 2;
func (i++, i++);
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any particular
order.  Either increment might happen first.  <CODE>func</CODE> might get the
arguments <SAMP>`2, 3'</SAMP>, or it might get <SAMP>`3, 2'</SAMP>, or even <SAMP>`2, 2'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<LI>
Making certain warnings into errors by default.
<P>

Some ISO C testsuites report failure when the compiler does not produce
an error message for a certain program.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1555"></A>
ISO C requires a "diagnostic" message for certain kinds of invalid
programs, but a warning is defined by GCC to count as a diagnostic.  If
GCC produces a warning but not an error, that is correct ISO C support.
If testsuites call this "failure", they should be run with the GCC
option <SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP>, which will turn these warnings into
errors.

<H2> 11.10 Warning Messages and Error Messages </H2>

The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
<EM>Errors</EM> report problems that make it impossible to compile your
program.  GCC reports errors with the source file name and line
number where the problem is apparent.
<P>

<LI>
<EM>Warnings</EM> report other unusual conditions in your code that
<EM>may</EM> indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does)
proceed.  Warning messages also report the source file name and line
number, but include the text <SAMP>`warning:'</SAMP> to distinguish them
from error messages.
</UL>
<P>

Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.  Many
warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>
options (for instance, <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> requests a variety of useful
warnings).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1559"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1560"></A>
GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic <EM>must</EM> be issued by a conforming
compiler.  The <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> option tells GCC to issue warnings in
such cases; <SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP> says to make them errors instead.
This does not mean that <EM>all</EM> non-ISO constructs get warnings
or errors.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC16">Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</A>, for
more detail on these and related command-line options.

When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it is
already known.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC177">11. Known Causes of Trouble with GCC</A>.  If it isn't known, then you should
report the problem.

<H2> 12.1 Have You Found a Bug? </H2>
<!--docid::SEC193::-->
<P>

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some guidelines:
</P><P>

<UL>
<A NAME="IDX1561"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1562"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1563"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1564"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input whatever
(except an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement), that is a compiler bug, unless the
compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would ordinarily
prevent the assembler from being run.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1565"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1566"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1567"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not correctly
execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.
<P>

However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have a
program whose behavior is undefined, which happened by chance to give
the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.
</P><P>

For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write <SAMP>`x;'</SAMP>
at the end of a function instead of <SAMP>`return x;'</SAMP>, with the same
results.  But the value of the function is undefined if <CODE>return</CODE>
is omitted; it is not a bug when GCC produces different results.
</P><P>

Problems often result from expressions with two increment operators,
as in <CODE>f (*p++, *p++)</CODE>.  Your previous compiler might have
interpreted that expression the way you intended; GCC might
interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
in your code.
</P><P>

After you have localized the error to a single source line, it should
be easy to check for these things.  If your program is correct and
well defined, you have found a compiler bug.
</P><P>

<LI>
If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is a
compiler bug.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1568"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
"invalid input" might be someone else's idea of "an extension" or
"support for traditional practice".
<P>

<LI>
If you are an experienced user of one of the languages GCC supports, your
suggestions for improvement of GCC are welcome in any case.

<H1> Funding Free Software </H1>
<!--docid::SEC197::-->
<P>

If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.
</P><P>

Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.
</P><P>

The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors
they must compete to be the one who gives the most.
</P><P>

To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.
</P><P>

Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.
If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably
less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.
</P><P>

Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;
but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and
what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more;
major new features or packages contribute the most.
</P><P>

By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system which is free software: the GNU system.  (GNU is a
recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"; it is pronounced
"guh-NEW".)  Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the
kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often
referred to as "Linux", they are more accurately called GNU/Linux
systems.

<H2> Preamble </H2>
<!--docid::SEC200::-->
<P>

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
</P><P>

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.
</P><P>

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
</P><P>

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.
</P><P>

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.
</P><P>

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
</P><P>

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
</P><P>

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.
</P><P>

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
</P><P>

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</P><P>

<A NAME="SEC201"></A>
<H2> TERMS AND CONDITIONS </H2>
<!--docid::SEC201::-->
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Definitions.
<P>

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
</P><P>

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.
</P><P>

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
</P><P>

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
</P><P>

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
</P><P>

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
</P><P>

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.
</P><P>

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
</P><P>

<LI>Source Code.
<P>

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form
of a work.
</P><P>

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
</P><P>

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
</P><P>

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
</P><P>

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
</P><P>

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.
</P><P>

<LI>Basic Permissions.
<P>

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
</P><P>

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
</P><P>

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
</P><P>

<LI>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<P>

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
</P><P>

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.
</P><P>

<LI>Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<P>

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
</P><P>

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
</P><P>

<LI>Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<P>

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.
<P>

<LI>
The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
notices".
<P>

<LI>
You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.
<P>

<LI>
If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
</OL>
<P>

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
</P><P>

<LI>Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<P>

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.
<P>

<LI>
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<P>

<LI>
Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.
<P>

<LI>
Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.
<P>

<LI>
Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.
<P>

</OL>
<P>

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
</P><P>

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
"normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.
</P><P>

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.
</P><P>

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
</P><P>

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.
</P><P>

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
</P><P>

<LI>Additional Terms.
<P>

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
</P><P>

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
</P><P>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<P>

<LI>
Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or
<P>

<LI>
Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<P>

<LI>
Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or
<P>

<LI>
Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<P>

<LI>
Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
</OL>
<P>

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
</P><P>

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
</P><P>

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.
</P><P>

<LI>Termination.
<P>

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
</P><P>

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</P><P>

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</P><P>

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
</P><P>

<LI>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<P>

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
</P><P>

<LI>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<P>

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
</P><P>

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
</P><P>

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
</P><P>

<LI>Patents.
<P>

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
</P><P>

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
</P><P>

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
</P><P>

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
</P><P>

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
</P><P>

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
</P><P>

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
</P><P>

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
</P><P>

<LI>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<P>

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.
</P><P>

<LI>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<P>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
</P><P>

<LI>Revised Versions of this License.
<P>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
</P><P>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
</P><P>

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.
</P><P>

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
</P><P>

<LI>Disclaimer of Warranty.
<P>

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
</P><P>

<LI>Limitation of Liability.
<P>

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</P><P>

<LI>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<P>

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

<H2> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs </H2>
<!--docid::SEC203::-->
<P>

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
</P><P>

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</P><P>

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</P><P>

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre><VAR>program</VAR> Copyright (C) <VAR>year</VAR> <VAR>name of author</VAR>

under certain conditions; type <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP> for details.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The hypothetical commands <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".
</P><P>

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<LI>
PREAMBLE
<P>

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <EM>free</EM> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</P><P>

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</P><P>

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</P><P>

<LI>
APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
<P>

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</P><P>

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</P><P>

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</P><P>

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</P><P>

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</P><P>

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</P><P>

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <FONT SIZE="-1">SGML</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">XML</FONT> using a publicly available
<FONT SIZE="-1">DTD</FONT>, and standard-conforming simple <FONT SIZE="-1">HTML</FONT>,
PostScript or <FONT SIZE="-1">PDF</FONT> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <FONT SIZE="-1">PNG</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">XCF</FONT> and
<FONT SIZE="-1">JPG</FONT>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <FONT SIZE="-1">SGML</FONT> or
<FONT SIZE="-1">XML</FONT> for which the <FONT SIZE="-1">DTD</FONT> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <FONT SIZE="-1">HTML</FONT>,
PostScript or <FONT SIZE="-1">PDF</FONT> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</P><P>

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</P><P>

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</P><P>

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
</P><P>

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</P><P>

<LI>
VERBATIM COPYING
<P>

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</P><P>

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</P><P>

<LI>
COPYING IN QUANTITY
<P>

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</P><P>

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</P><P>

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</P><P>

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</P><P>

<LI>
MODIFICATIONS
<P>

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
<P>

<LI>
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.
<P>

<LI>
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.
<P>

<LI>
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
<P>

<LI>
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.
<P>

<LI>
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
<P>

<LI>
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
<P>

<LI>
Include an unaltered copy of this License.
<P>

<LI>
Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.
<P>

<LI>
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
<P>

<LI>
For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.
<P>

<LI>
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
<P>

<LI>
Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.
<P>

<LI>
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
<P>

<LI>
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</OL>
<P>

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</P><P>

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</P><P>

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</P><P>

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</P><P>

<LI>
COMBINING DOCUMENTS
<P>

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</P><P>

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</P><P>

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all
sections Entitled "Endorsements."
</P><P>

<LI>
COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
<P>

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</P><P>

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</P><P>

<LI>
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
<P>

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</P><P>

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</P><P>

<LI>
TRANSLATION
<P>

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</P><P>

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</P><P>

<LI>
TERMINATION
<P>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</P><P>

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</P><P>

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</P><P>

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</P><P>

<LI>
FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
<P>

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</A>.
</P><P>

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</P><P>

<LI>
RELICENSING
<P>

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</P><P>

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</P><P>

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</P><P>

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</P><P>

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<H2> ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents </H2>
<!--docid::SEC205::-->
<P>

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>  Copyright (C)  <VAR>year</VAR>  <VAR>your name</VAR>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>    with the Invariant Sections being <VAR>list their titles</VAR>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <VAR>list</VAR>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <VAR>list</VAR>.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</P><P>

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<P>On some systems, <SAMP>`gcc -shared'</SAMP>
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, <SAMP>`gcc -shared'</SAMP> must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
is innocuous.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="gcc.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>Future versions of GCC may zero-extend, or use
a target-defined <CODE>ptr_extend</CODE> pattern.  Do not rely on sign extension.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="gcc.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>The analogous feature in
Fortran is called an assigned goto, but that name seems inappropriate in
C, where one can do more than simply store label addresses in label
variables.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="gcc.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>A file's <EM>basename</EM>
was the name stripped of all leading path information and of trailing
suffixes, such as <SAMP>`.h'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`.C'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`.cc'</SAMP>.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="gcc.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>The C++ standard just uses the
term "dependent" for names that depend on the type or value of
template parameters.  This shorter term will also be used in the rest of
this section.
