on boot get the initial values form the exception vector table
	Power on reset
		Program Counter (PC) address H'00000000
		Stack Pointer (SP) address H'00000004
	Manual reset
		Program Counter (PC) address H'00000008
		Stack Pointer (SP) address H'0000000C

Clear the vector base register to H'00000000

The interrupt mask bits(I3 to I0) in the status register(SR) are set to H'0000000F (1111)

The BO and CS bits are init to 0.

The BN bit in IBNR of INTC is set to 0
FPU and FPSCR are init to H'00040001

program execution starts from the PC address fetched from the exception table
